CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

CHAIRMAN ’ S STATEMENT

Despite UC RUSAL’s steadfast adherence to
ongoing strategic production discipline, which
resulted in output decreasing by 7% compared
to 2013, RUSAL remained the world’s largest
aluminium company by production.
UC RUSAL’s robust financial results are not the
only measurement by which the Company should
be judged. As a Company which employs 62,000
people, the health and safety of all of our team
remains our key priority. We have a dedicated
committee for Health, Safety and the Environment
at Board level. In 2014, the Company achieved
100% standardisation of jobs within its Business
System, including working conditions and safety of
performed operations, and proactively conducted a
widespread behavioural safety audit.
UC RUSAL’s total investment in employee
safety reached USD68 million in 2014, with total
expenditures on labour and industrial safety for
the last 3 years amounting to USD225 million. As
in 2013, there were no significant emergencies,
incidents, fires or transport accidents in 2014.
The lost time accident frequency rate decreased
by 13.6%, while the lost time injury severity rate
decreased by 10.8%
Total investment in environmental protection
between 2012 and 2014 amounted to USD295
million. As an environmentally conscious company,

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
“With time and patience the mulberry leaf
becomes a silk gown,” so goes the famous Chinese
saying. These words highlight the importance of
goal-setting and the dedication required to reach
these goals. After a few challenging years, UC
RUSAL has seen steady progress across its key
performance metrics in 2014. Despite a tough start
to the year, both profit and cash flow generation
improved significantly in the second half. The
Board and I are very pleased with this performance
trajectory.
In 2014, global primary aluminium demand
reached 55.2 million tonnes, recording outstanding
growth of 7%. UC RUSAL’s in-house supply-demand
balance forecast envisages an ex-China deficit of
around 1 million tonnes through to 2018.
Against the current backdrop, UC RUSAL’s strategy
to focus on economically and environmentally efficient
production is paying off. The management team has
continued to pursue a stringent cost management
strategy and with the support of external market
factors successfully reduced aluminium cash cost to
USD1,671/t in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted
EBITDA margin improved to 26.1% in the fourth
quarter of 2014, while the Adjusted EBITDA margin for
the year was 16.2% against just 6.7% in 2013.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

I am pleased to welcome Vladislav Soloviev
as CEO of UC RUSAL. Vladislav first joined the
Company back in 2000 and enjoyed success as
the Company’s First Deputy CEO, where he had
an impressive track record of increasing RUSAL’s
business efficiency and improving production and
financial performance. I would also like to thank
Oleg Deripaska, who is now the Company’s
President, for his tenure as CEO during which he led
the Company through a challenging period.
Finally, I would like to thank all of our employees
for their commitment and dedication and our
shareholders for their continued support.

UC RUSAL implemented a range of programmes
to curtail hazardous emissions and achieved a
reduction in carbon emission intensity per tonne of
aluminum of 11% in comparison with 2011.
UC RUSAL constantly upgrades its facilities to
increase the amount of recycled and reusable water
utilised during the production process. Compared
to 2011, industrial waste has decreased by 45%.
We are conscious at climate change and are
continuously looking to decrease CO2 emissions. In
2014, we reached a goal set in 1990 to decrease
emissions by 50% by the beginning of 2015.
No less important are the Company’s ongoing
modernisation and innovation projects. We continue
to invest in the modernisation and upgrade of our
existing capacities, as well as building efficient
upstream vertical integration and increasing the
value-added product mix. A new casting line with
120kt of large diameter billets (460mm) capacity
is under construction at the Krasnoyarsk aluminium
smelter. In addition, wire rod capacity (KAZ) of 50kt
and slab capacity of 105kt (SAZ) were added to the
Company’s portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2014.
From 2014 to 2016, the Company, together
with the Russian Ministry of Education and
the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade, is
implementing several R&D projects with ministerial
grants exceeding RUB 490 million. In particular,
these projects cover the production of Al-Sc alloys,
increasing the strength of nano-structured aluminium
alloys for use in electrical engineering, as well as
producing a new generation of sparingly alloyed
heavy duty materials. In addition, energy-saving
solutions are being tested for use in the aluminium
reduction process with early results showing
electricity consumption fell by 300-1,000 kW*h/t
of aluminium.
UC RUSAL continued to deliver on its social
agenda in 2014. Total investment in charitable and
social projects in the reporting period was around
USD13 million. We are very proud that one of
our four major social initiatives – the “Territory of
RUSAL” program – has won in the “Creating the
Future” category at the first All-Russian competition
held by the Ministry of Education and Science of
Russia in 2014 which recognizes employers’ work
with children, youth and talent pool.
I would also like to mention an important postreporting period CSR project. On January 17, 2015
the Company officially opened an Ebola center in
Guinea, making it the only public company globally
to initiate a major construction project to help fight
the spread of Ebola. The Company’s investment
in the construction of the Centre amounts to over
USD10 million.
Looking to the future, we forecast aluminium
demand growth, while the ex-China market
deficit will support the aluminium price. The macro
environment also remains supportive for the
aluminium market.

CEO’S REVIEW

CEO ’ S REVIEW

2014 was another noteworthy year for both
UC RUSAL and the aluminium sector. For me,
this marks the first time I am writing to you, our
shareholders, as Chief Executive Officer of
UC RUSAL. I am very honoured to hold this position
at this great company, and will work tirelessly to
ensure that we continue to be recognised as the
world’s leading aluminium producer. Aluminium
continues to be used in an ever greater range
of products and the opportunities open to us are
very exciting. Having gone through a difficult but
important transformation, RUSAL is well positioned
to deliver long-term value and growth for all
stakeholders.
The period under review was mixed for the
aluminium sector, in the first quarter the aluminium
price fell to its lowest level in almost five years,
however positive market price dynamics supported
by growing demand and ex-China deficit helped
the sector recover in the middle of the year. In the
fourth quarter of 2014, the slump in global oil
prices coupled with a strengthening of the US Dollar
depressed most commodities’ prices, with the LME
price for aluminium declining back to levels below
USD1,900 per tonne.
Against the backdrop of such a volatile
environment, RUSAL focused on the key elements
of its operational strategy in order to return to

profitability. These remain: efficiency enhancement,
stringent cost control through the whole production
chain, and increasing production of high margin
value-added products.
Our steadfast commitment to curtailing inefficient
production resulted in primary aluminium production
decreasing 6.6% to 3.6 million tonnes, with
aluminium segment cash cost per tonne reducing
9.3% to USD1,729 per tonne. In addition, our share
of value-added products reached a record high of
45% of total aluminium production and we remain
on track to achieve our target of 55% by 2020.
Thanks to the efforts taken by RUSAL over the
period coupled with a depreciation of the Russian
Rouble and Ukrainian Hryvna we achieved a robust
set of results. While revenues decreased by 4.1% to
USD9,357 million, primarily due to the lower sales
of primary aluminium and alloys, which accounted
for 83.6% of RUSAL’s revenue in 2014 and 2013,
Adjusted EBITDA increased by USD863 million or
by 132.6% to USD1,514 in 2014 as compared to
USD651 million for the preceding year. Recurring
Net Profit for the year ended 31 December 2014
was USD486 million compared to a Recurring Net
Loss of USD598 million for the preceding year.
During the period, RUSAL completed an
important corporate event with the refinancing of
our debt portfolio which included PXF and bilateral

facilities. The terms agreed allow RUSAL to
postpone the scheduled repayments of principal
until January 2016. In December 2014, the
Company took the prudent decision to make
an early repayment of USD300 million of the
outstanding debt in addition to USD53 million
repaid in the fourth quarter of 2014 through the
cash sweep mechanism. Thanks to these efforts
and our robust financial results, RUSAL achieved a
leverage ratio below 4.5:1 which will decrease the
interest rate margin from March 2015.
With the ramifications of the 2009 industry crisis
firmly in our mindset, the Company has no plans
to restart any mothballed aluminium capacity,
regardless of the LME price. Optimisation of
production capacity is a long-term way to ensure the

industry does not face another overproduction crisis,
and the Company is committed to maintaining stable
aluminium output, albeit with marginal increases
following the commencement of operations at the
Boguchansky aluminium smelter.
Looking forward at the industry as a whole,
we believe that global aluminium demand will
grow by 6.5% in 2015 to 59 million tonnes, while
production growth outside of China will continue
to be limited, with 1.1 million tonnes remaining in
supply deficit. We have recently witnessed LME
stocks decline below a psychologically important
mark of 4 million tonnes and based on the current
supply and demand balance, we estimate that
inventories will return to their historically normal
level in 2016.

CEO’S REVIEW

During 2014, RUSAL demonstrated its ability to
respond to very challenging market conditions and
our steadfast adherence to our corporate strategy
led to a strong set of results. Given the mixed year
for the sector we are by no means complacent and
remain dedicated to our corporate strategy which
leaves RUSAL well positioned to continue its growth
trajectory into the future. I would like to thank all our
employees and other stakeholders for their ongoing
support and commitment, both of which give me
great confidence in our future.

The total installed capacity of all nine hydrounits in operation amounts to 3,000 MW. The
actual capacity of nine hydro-units in operation
amounts to 2,880 MW. The plant will reach its
full capacity of 3,000 MW once the reservoir
level is filled to the design reservoir level of 208m
(the reservoir level as of the end of 2014 was
204.94m). The reservoir should be filled during
2015. Once the design capacity is achieved, the
BEMO HPP will become one of Russia’s five largest
hydropower plants.
The plant has started commercial supplies to
the wholesale electricity and capacity market on
December 1, 2012. Since its launch the BEMO HPP

has generated 13.679 TWh of electricity. During
2014, the plant has supplied 8.362 TWh to the
wholesale electricity and capacity market.
UC RUSAL’s proportion of capital expenditure
for the BEMO Project is 50%. The total capital
expenditure for the BEMO HPP, incurred
and to be incurred, is currently estimated to
be approximately USD2,116 million6 (UC
RUSAL’s share of this capital expenditure will
be approximately USD1,058 million), of which
USD2,053 million had been spent as of 31
December 2014 (of which UC RUSAL’s share
amounted to USD1,027 million).
The Investment Fund of the Russian Federation
finances the necessary infrastructure (the costs of
which are not included in the project budget). The
total investment from the Investment Fund approved
by the Russian Government for the BEMO Project
amounted to RUB26.4 billion.

Norilsk Nickel is the world’s largest nickel
and palladium producer and one of the leading
producers of platinum and copper. UC RUSAL held
a 27.82% shareholding in Norilsk Nickel as at the
Latest Practicable Date.
UC RUSAL’s shareholding in Norilsk Nickel
allows for significant diversification of earnings,
through Norilsk Nickel’s exposure to PGMs8 and
bulk materials, and also broadens UC RUSAL’s
strategic opportunities. The Company’s objective
is to maximise the value of this investment for all
shareholders.
Company profile9
Norilsk Nickel is the world leader in production
of nickel and palladium. Norilsk Nickel’s Resource
Base in Taimyr and Kola Peninsula as of December
31, 2013, consists of 873 mt of Proved and
Probable Ore Reserves and 2,018 mt of Measured
and Indicated Mineral Resources (compared with
503 mt of Proved and Probable Ore Reserves and
1 597 mt of Measured and Indicated Mineral
Resources as of December 31, 2011). Its key assets
are located in Norilsk region and Kola Peninsula
in Russia, with foreign assets located in Finland,
Australia, Botswana and South Africa.
In 2014, Norilsk Nickel produced 274 kt of
nickel, 368 kt of copper, 2,749,000 ounces of
palladium and 657 thousand ounces of platinum.
Reduced production of Nickel (-4%) and Copper
(-1%) was mainly the result of the sale of Lake
Johnston (Australia) in the third quarter of 2014 and
by a significant reduction in production in Botswana
(due to a smaller grade of raw materials processed).
Increasing of production of PGM (+3% Palladium,
+1% Platinum) is mainly caused by the processing of
work in progress in Russia.
On May 19, 2014, Norilsk Nickel presented an
update of its new strategy in London (previously its
new strategy was presented on October 4, 2013 in
London as well). According to the new approach, the
key priority of Norilsk Nickel is (1) refocusing on Tier
I assets (annual revenue higher than USD1 billion,
EBITDA margin more than 40%: Polar Division, Kola
Division and NN Harjavalta, Chita project), (2)
Optimizing Value Chain Footprint, (3) Capital and
Investment Discipline, and (4) Social Responsibility.

swaps by:
• exploring growth opportunities in regions
with stranded, low-cost captive electricity
supply and preparing for the next upward
momentum in the cycle;
• enhancing bauxite and alumina selfsufficiency by continuously reviewing existing
currently mothballed alumina refineries, and
exploring new opportunities in geographically
diverse regions and exploiting regional
supply/demand imbalances; and
• securing access to and self-sufficiency in key
production inputs.
5. Managing environmental protection matters
and utilising natural resources responsibly by
ensuring all of UC RUSAL’s production facilities
meet emission standards set by local laws in
the jurisdictions where UC RUSAL conducts its
business.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY POLICIES
As with other natural resources and mineral
processing companies, the Group’s operations
create hazardous and non-hazardous waste,
effluent emissions into the atmosphere, as well as
water, soil and safety concerns for its workforce.
Consequently, the Group is required to comply
with a range of health, safety and environmental
laws and regulations. The Group believes that
its operations are in compliance with all material
respects with the applicable health, safety and
environmental legislations of the Russian Federation,
including its regions, and the countries and

regions where the Group’s plants are situated. The
Group regularly reviews and updates its health,
safety and environmental management practices
and procedures to ensure where feasible that
they comply, or continue to comply, with best
international standards.
Operating on five continents and being involved
in the metal production and processing, mining and
power generation industries, UC RUSAL shares
responsibility for addressing regional and global
environmental issues and finding cutting edge
approaches to solving such problems. The Company
considers its environmental protection activities
to be an inherent part of its business as well as its
contribution to public sustainable development
projects.
UC RUSAL’s goal is to facilitate the gradual
improvement of environmental indicators, while
taking into account practical possibilities and social
and economic factors.
The following guidelines are adhered to when
making management decisions at all levels and in
all areas of the Company’s business:
• Risk Management: define and assess
environmental risks, set targets and plan
work taking into account environmental risk
management issues;
• Compliance: comply with environmental
legislative requirements of the countries where
UC RUSAL has operations, as well as comply
with environmental covenants assumed by the
Company;
• Prevention: apply the best available techniques
and methods to prevent pollution, minimise risks
of environmental accidents and other negative
impacts on the environment;
• Training: train employees of the Company to
meet the environmental requirements applicable
to their business areas to give employees a
better understanding of the environmental
consequences should such requirements not be
met;
• Cooperation: note the opinions and interests
of related parties, establish environmental
requirements when selecting suppliers and
contractors and assist them in complying with
those requirements;
• Measurability and evaluation: establish,
measure and evaluate environmental indicators
and assess compliance with environmental
legislation in the countries where UC RUSAL
operates and with environmental covenants
assumed by the Company; and
• Openness: openly demonstrate the Company’s
plans and results of its environmental activities,
including through public reports issued by the
Company.
Key goals of UC RUSAL’s environmental strategy
include:
• reducing emissions, including greenhouse gases;
22

• creating a closed-circuit water supply system for
the main production processes of the Company’s
facilities;
• increasing the volume of treated and used waste
products and their safe disposal;
• replacing and disposing of electrical equipment
containing polychlorbiphenyls (PCBs);
• rehabilitating land which has been negatively
impacted and assisting in the maintenance of
biodiversity; and
• creating corporate systems to manage
environmental aspects and risks.
By following this environmental policy and
undertaking to regularly review and update
its provisions, the Company has tasked itself
to be constantly developing and improving
its environmental management system and
implementing its principles at all production
facilities of UC RUSAL, including all those which
are in operation and those which are still under
construction.
The Group has also taken steps to lessen the
environmental impact of its operations and complied
with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
In 2007 the Company signed a memorandum
of understanding with the United Nations
Development Program. The aim of the memorandum
is to implement measures to minimise the Group’s
impact on climate change, by reducing the Group’s
greenhouse gas emissions. The Group is actively
participating in the International Aluminium Institute’s
activities related to targeting the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency.
The Group has achieved significant reductions
in greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, the
Group’s aluminium smelters reduced greenhouse
gas emissions in 2014 by 53% compared to 1990
emissions levels.
As part of achieving its objectives of continuous
development and improvement of the environmental
management system, the Company pays special
attention to certifying its factories for compliance
with ISO 14001, the international standard for
environmental management systems. All UC
RUSAL’s aluminium smelters are certified as ISO
14001 compliant.
UC RUSAL’s activities to provide safe working
conditions for employees and reduce occupational
diseases and injuries are governed by the
corporate Occupational Health and Safety Policy.
The Company’s efforts are integrated into the
Occupational Health and Safety Management
System, which is one of the crucial management
systems in UC RUSAL’s business.
12 LOST TIME ACCIDENT RATE (per
MHW) is the number of Lost Time
Accidents (LTI) that occurred over
a period time per 1 000 000 Man

The Company has the following health and
safety objectives:
• To strive for zero injuries, zero emergencies and
zero fires;
• To ensure the compliance of equipment and
production processes with legal and regulatory
requirements for occupational health, industrial
and fire safety;
• To ensure personnel safety and health in the
workplace, and improve workplace environment
on an ongoing basis in order to increase the
level of safety;
• To prevent occupational diseases.
The Occupational Health and Safety
Management System is deployed at every
production facility. It includes a risk management
system, emergency response plans, budgeting of
health and safety measures, personnel training
based on national and corporate requirements, and
a corporate e-learning system.
Occupational health and fire safety measures
are financed strictly on a timely basis to provide
for identification of hazards and development
of procedures to improve working conditions. In
2014, the Company spent USD68 million on these
measures.
UC RUSAL pays special attention to establishing
a constructive dialogue with state authorities and
employees, business partners, the general public
and expert organisations to jointly resolve health
and safety issues. The Company’s experts and
managers participate in the legislative process
through the Occupational Health, Safety and
Environmental Committee of the Russian Union
of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Russian Duma
committees, federal ministries and services, the
Russian Chamber of Industry and Commerce,
the Russian Mining Trade Union, the Russian
Association of Mining Industrialists, and other nonprofit organisations and partnerships.
Among the universally accepted health and
safety management systems is a system based on
the OHSAS 18001:2007 international standard.
Regular audits of this system at UC RUSAL is
strengthened by numerous regular internal
audits, which qualitatively and quantitatively
assess key elements of the system, identify
deficiencies and develop effective corrective
measures to manage risks and prevent failures
and injuries. According to 2014 data, the LTAR
(Lost Time Accident Rate12) was 0.95 which is
an improvement compared to 2013 (1.1) and
the global average for the aluminium industry in
2014 (1.5).

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

SOCIAL INVESTMENTS AND CHARITY
The following key principles form the foundation
of UC RUSAL’s social activities: the long-term
strategy, maximal efficiency, partnership, equal
opportunities and qualitative changes.
The Social Programms Center (CSP), the
Company’s charitable foundation, which has
operated for 10 years since 2004, continues its role
as an expertise center in the field of advanced social
technologies, corporate charity and volunteering in
the regions where UC RUSAL operates.
The Company and its CSP implement social
investment in active cooperation with numerous
partners from the regional and municipal
administrations, social non-profit organizations and
business associations. Keeping the focus on the best
global practices of social activities we aim to share
our experience and knowledge with our partners in
the field.
In 2014, the Company’s social investments
focused on four key programms: RUSAL’s Territory,
Helping is Easy, Formula for the Future, and Social
Entrepreneurship Development Program.

Helping is Easy
Encouragement of corporate volunteering and
promotion of the culture of volunteering are priorities
for UC RUSAL. The previous “RUSAL’s First Aid”
program in 2014 developed into the “Helping is Easy”
program aimed at addressing social issues through
growing the number of corporate volunteers and
partners and increasing their voluntary contribution. In
2014 the Company launched the web portal of the
“Helping is Easy“ program that helps bring together
volunteers and charitable organizations interested in
joint social activities. 800 corporate volunteers and
165 organizations actively communicated through it to
carry out 242 social events.
During 2014, corporate volunteers of UC RUSAL
continued providing social activities and events
for social and educational institutions. They visited
children’s homes for activities with kids and provide
a training course for law-abiding behaviour and
prevention of legal issues faced by young people
upon leaving the children’s home. The School
for Volunteers ran in nine cities for promotion of
volunteering among non-profit organizations and
city residents.
The larger volunteer projects in 2014 were the
traditional environmental action “Day of the Eniseyriver”, and charitable project “The New Year
Marathon”, and “We believe in miracles and make
them come true!”. 3,447 volunteers, including UC
RUSAL’s field employees with their family members
and representatives of other partner companies and
organizations, carried out 956 social events of the
New Year Marathon in 18 cities. 1,878 holiday
gifts were donated by Company volunteers and
delivered to children from disadvantaged families
and children’s homes.
UC RUSAL’s experience in promotion of
volunteering has been recognized in 2014 and

Rusal’s Territory
The RUSAL’s Territory program is aimed at
significantly improving the quality of life of people
in the regions where the Company operates through
the creation and rehabilitation of social infrastructure
and comfortable urban environments and through
support of social projects in the areas of education,
culture, sports and recreation.
In 2014, the program’s grant funding provided
support for the implementation of 88 projects. It
included the Krasnoyarsk city youth park with a
modern design and the capacity to accommodate
up to five thousand young people who come to
practice sports, dances, games and attend open air
shows. Medical occupational guidance activities
for high school students were organized in Bratsk
(Irkutsk region). In Achinsk (Krasnoyarsk territory),
a new adaptive playground was set up for the
disable children, which is unique in the town. In
Novokuznetsk, a kindergarten was equipped
with modern ophthalmological tools for visually
impaired children and the municipal center for
children’s technical education received a modern

employees seeking to participate in the life of
their enterprise and the city. The program allows
strengthening of mutual horizontal communication
between young participants from different
departments and divisions of the Company. They
are willingly taking part in the development of the
Company and local communities, reaching their
potential in new non-production areas.
To implement the program there are nine youth
councils acting at the Company’s enterprises, uniting
500 active young employees. During 2014, they
took part in the introduction of innovations in the
production system of the enterprises, organized
and held 233 social and volunteer events and
contributed to occupational guidance for the
students of high schools and higher educational
institutions.
Training courses and workshops in social
activities and projects are conducted for the
program participants. In 2014, the School for Active
Youth was implemented at nine industrial sites,
where 150 young employees of RUSAL together
with the representatives of other local companies
and youth organizations received training relating to
social projects development. This helped to establish
partnerships with colleagues from other institutions
and to organize joint activities.
In a further development of the program it is
planned to expand it to a city-wide and interregional level, as well as to launch within the
program a competition of youth projects in the field
of scientific-and-technological, environmental,
artistic and sports activities.
The overall amount of the funds UC RUSAL
invested in social programms, charity and
sponsorship in 2014 totalled USD12.7 million.

“Social Entrepreneurship Development” program
Improving quality of life in the regions where the
Company is present is our priority and, as proved
by the experience of the program implementation;
social entrepreneurship creates good opportunities
for involvement of active local residents in
addressing social problems in their city, and for
co-ordinating all existing national and regional
resources to achieve these goals.
In 2014, UC RUSAL continued supporting and
promoting social entrepreneurship in the regions
where it operates. The geography of the network
of the Company’s Centers for Innovation in the
Social Sphere expanded from three to five cities.
For the first time Social Entrepreneurship Schools
were launched in Achinsk (Krasnoyarsk territory)
and Severouralsk (Sverdlovsk region). In five
cities, a total of 120 new social entrepreneurs
were trained and started developing their
initiatives in the social sphere. During 2014,
the active projects of the training program
participants created 48 new jobs.
The Company is helping the graduates of the
training program to successfully launch their social
businesses. When faced with a lack of initial funding
at the launch stage, the Company took several steps
to address this problem. In particular, the graduates
given assistance with obtaining municipal subsidies
from agencies that support small and medium-sized
entrepreneurship. Then RUSAL together with partner
bank Soyuz and the municipality of Krasnoyarsk
presented the programme to provide preferential
credit business projects of social infrastructure
development in the city of Krasnoyarsk. In addition,
the Company introduced in 2014 for the first time
interest-free loans for projects of its training program
graduates. Among the supported projects are
bookstore and reading club project and an informal
educational center for pre-school and school age
children in Krasnoyarsk, after-school childcare
centre and natural wood products workshop in
Krasnoturyinsk, as well as the guide dog training
project in Bratsk.
The Company has been recognized for its
contribution and systemic approach to development
of social entrepreneurship in Russia with the AllRussian annual award “Force for Good”. Its training
won the annual employer competition “Creating the
Future” introduced by the Ministry of Education and
Science of Russia.
“Formula for the Future” program

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

Global aluminum demand
Global aluminium demand rose to 55.2 million
tonnes, or 7%, during 2014 compared to 2013.
This is above UC RUSAL’s latest forecast of 55
million tonnes, mainly as a result of stronger demand
in North America and China in the fourth quarter
of 2014. At the same time, demand in emerging
markets including Russia, Latin America and India
showed lower consumption in the fourth quarter
of 2014 as a result of missed expectations for the
entire 2014 forecast.
UC RUSAL expects another 6.5% global
aluminium demand growth in 2015 to 59 million
tonnes, including 9.5% growth in China and a 3.4%
growth out of China with the possibility of stronger
growth in the second half of 2015, particularly due
to the EU Quantitative Easing stimulus program to
be started at the beginning of the first half of 2015.
North American demand is expected to show the
strongest growth in 2015, growing by 5.4% yearon-year.
UC RUSAL expects aluminium demand from
carmakers will grow by 7% in 2015 as car sales
combined with the aluminium content in cars are
expected to increase significantly. Automakers
consumed a record amount of aluminum last
year as plummeting prices and technological
breakthroughs made it a viable alternative
to steel. The temporary plunge in oil price is
expected to create additional demand for cars as
US market statistics in January 2015 recorded a
nearly 14% January sales increase and over half

OVERVIEW OF TRENDS IN INDUSTRY AND
BUSINESS
Key Highlights
• The slump in global oil prices and the
strengthening of the US Dollar may negatively
affect commodities in the short-term but in
the mid-term, the lower oil price is expected
to boost economic growth in oil importing
countries including the G7 and China, resulting
therefore in an increase in industrial metals
consumption.
• Global aluminum demand is forecast to grow by
6.5% in 2015 to 59 million tonnes.
• Production growth outside of China will remain
at a 1.1 million tonne supply deficit.
• Aluminum LME stocks are forecast to further
decline to 2.6 million tonnes by the end of 2015
based on the current supply/demand balance
and the new LME warehouse policy. LME stocks
are expected to return to a normal historical level
in 2016.
• Premiums are expected to continue to be
supported by regional market deficits,
particularly in North America and Europe.
• The Chinese domestic aluminum market
continues to be oversupplied by fast growing
capacity, which translates into a low Shanghai
Futures Exchange (“SHFE”) price. The situation
should improve in 2015 with a possible 1.52 million tonnes of production cuts and slower
capacity growth.

AND ANALYSIS

Aluminium market improvements, coupled with weakening local currencies had
significant positive effects on the profitability and financial results of RUSAL. Focus on
strict production discipline, procurement optimization and product mix improvement
to a record-high 45% share of value-added products resulted in the increase of
Adjusted EBITDA by 132.6% to USD1,514 million in 2014. The Company successfully
completed the refinancing of its debt portfolio and reduced its net debt by 12.6%,
achieving a leverage ratio below 4.5:1 that decreased the interest rate margin
starting from March 2015. We believe we are well positioned to continue our growth
trajectory into the next reporting period.

Eurozone manufacturing PMI climbed to a 31 month
high to 50.6 with both output and new orders for
goods producers rising for six successive months.
Aluminium demand in Europe improved throughout
2014 growing by 3.0% year-on-year compared to
2013. The biggest rise came from Turkey (5.8%),
Germany (3.4%), Spain (5.4%) and Italy (4.1%).
Construction output slipped in November 2014
month on month, both throughout the EU (down
0.2%) and in the Eurozone (down 0.1%).
The West European car market edged up in
December 2014 and posted a 4.7% growth for the
year. December’s market growth was the sixteenth
consecutive month of growth in Western Europe and
the 2014 calendar year market increased by 4.7%
to 12.1 million units.

China
China’s primary aluminum consumption was 28
million tonnes in 2014, an 11% increase year-on-year.
According to data provided by the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturing (“CAAM”),
China produced 21.431 million automobiles
between January and November 2014, growth of
7.2% compared to the same period in 2013, and
21.079 million units were sold in the same period in
2014, a 6.1% increase year-on-year.
The performance of the domestic real estate
industry was still weak in 2014 under macro-control
measures. The real estate industry completed an
investment of Renminbi 9.5036 trillion with a yearon-year rise of 10.5% during January to December
2014 and the growth rate was 1.4% lower than that
for the first eleven months of 2014.
In the electric power industry, investments in
power grid projects decreased in 2014. The data
provided by the National Energy Administration
indicate that Renminbi 346.0 billion of fixed-asset
investments were completed in power grid projects
in China in the first eleven months of 2014, a 2.6%
increase compared to 2013.

Asia
Japan moved into recession in the third quarter
of 2014 as the impact of the sales tax hike in April
2014 resulted in a sharp decline in household
consumption. However, real GDP growth in Japan
is expected to be at 0.2% in 2014. PMI in Japan
stayed in expansion territory since June 2014 and
ended 2014 at 52.0.
Aluminium demand from the transportation
and construction sectors is estimated to account
for 43% and 15% respectively of total Japanese
aluminium demand in 2014. Construction
orders rose in October 2014 by 15.7% and
November 2014 by 16.9% suggesting the
industry recovering in the near future. Automotive
production in Japan has decreased since July
2014 year-on-year. Despite the decrease, the
strong automotive output in the first half of 2014
has brought 1.7% growth for 11 months in
comparison to the previous year.
South Korea’s economy expanded just 0.4%
during the fourth quarter of 2014 on sequential
terms, down from 0.9% in the third quarter of
2014, as government spending fell and exports
growth lagged. On an annual basis, the economy
is expected to have grown by 2.8% in 2014.
HSBC South Korea manufacturing PMI improved
for the third month, which increased from 48.7 in
October 2014 to 51.1 in January 2015. South
Korea’s automotive output during 2014 increased
by just 0.1% from the previous year to 4.525 million
vehicles. Vehicle exports fell by 0.9% to 3.061
million units whilst domestic sales increased by 6.5%
to 1.211 million in 2014. South Korea primary
aluminium consumption rose by 2.4% in 2014
compared to 2013.
India’s GDP growth is projected to be 5.5%
in 2014. Indian goods producers ended 2014
strongly, with business conditions improving at the
quickest pace in two years in December 2014.
India’s manufacturing PMI for December climbed
to 54.5, up from 53.3 in the prior month. Car sales
in India got back into positive territory in 2014

North America
North American demand for aluminium grew by
7.5% (year-on-year) in the fourth quarter of 2014.
UC RUSAL estimates that North American aluminium
consumption increased roughly by 4.8% in 2014
compared to 2013.
The transport sector remained the main driver of
aluminium consumption growth in the region. Light
vehicle sales for 2014 amounted to 16.4 million
units, a 5.8% increase compared to 2013, making
2014 the year with the highest sales since 2006.
North American light vehicle production increased
by 5.2% in 2014, the highest level since 2000. The
drop in gasoline prices is also adding to the already
favorable outlook for vehicle sales. The key theme
continues to be increased demand for automotive
body sheet.
Recovery in the building and construction sector
supported the demand for aluminium in 2014. The
US housing statistics increased to 1,089 thousand
units in December 2014. In 2014, there were
groundbreaking increases of 8.8% to 1.01 million
units, which is the highest since 2007.
Excluding can sheet, North American production
of aluminium sheet and plate has grown by 6.7%
year-on-year to 1.6 million tonnes during January
to November 2014. Extrusion orders in January to
November 2014 were up by 8.6%.

GDP rose by 0.8% in the Eurozone in 2014
compared to 2013 and in December 2014, the

semis exports. Globally, greater volatility in the
forward contango may also incentivise some
aluminum stocks from LME and off-warrant
warehouses into consumption, although in
general this is expected to balance out the
current aluminum market deficit.
Since the beginning of 2014, LME stocks have
dropped by 1.247 million tonnes to 4.15 million tonnes,
the lowest level recorded since December 2011. This
is in line with the market deficit outside of China in
2014. 60% of total stocks were cancelled at the LME,
maintaining high physical market demand. Aluminum
LME stocks are forecast to decline to 2.6 million tonnes
by the end of 2015 based on the current supply and
demand balance and the new LME warehouse policy.
LME aluminum stocks are expected to reach historically
normalised levels in 2016.
The Chinese market showed a continued decline
in aluminum stocks. Chinese visible inventories are
currently at a one year low of 415,328 metric
tonnes, marking a 803,375 metric tonnes decline
over the past 39 weeks (down from a four year
high to 1,218,703 metric tonnes). In the first week
of 2015, SHFE inventories experienced a 5,100
metric tonnes decline week-on-week (the sixth
consecutive weekly decline), to an 11-month low
of 202,328 metric tonnes. SHFE inventories have
declined by half since reaching a peak in May
2014 at 409,137 metric tonnes. Additionally, the
Wuxi and Nanhai spot market inventories fell by
1,000 mertic tonnes to a total of 213,000 metric
tonnes (a one year low).
It should be noted that more Chinese smelters
have become direct suppliers of liquid metal to
semis producer and thus the relationship between
aluminum stocks and domestic demand for aluminum
has weakened somewhat.

Global aluminum supply
Aluminum production in ex-China declined by
0.2% in 2014 year-on-year to 25.6 million tonnes,
after a 0.3% decline in 2013 year-on-year. More
than 1.3 million tonnes of capacity out of China was
cut in 2014, but at the same time around 200,000
tonnes of capacity was restarted. Production outside
China in 2015 is expected to increase by 4% due
to continued growth in Middle East, other Asian
countries and India. Around 320,000 tonnes of
Western smelter capacity may be restarted in
2015. At the same time, around 700,000 tonnes
of capacity may be curtailed due to low LME prices
and high power tariffs.
In 2014, the Ex-China aluminum market had a
1.2 million tonne shortfall and we expect another 1.1
million tonnes of shortfall in 2015 from Ex-China.
Overcapacity in the Chinese aluminium market
will persist for the coming months, weighing on
local prices and boosting the appeal of shipping
aluminium products overseas. Aluminium capacity
in China rose by 4.5 million tonnes in 2014 to 35.4
million tonnes as compared to 2013. More than
1.45 million tonnes of capacity was restarted for
the same period. This created additional supply
pressures in domestic markets and the SHFE price
has dropped by 16% since mid-September 2013.
This contributed around 47% of Chinese aluminium
production, or 13.3 million tonnes, loss making at
current SHFE prices.
The continuation of aluminium at a low price
may encourage around 1.5 to 2 million tonnes of
capacity closures in China in 2015. More than
500,000 tonnes of production is already set to be
closed in the first quarter of 2015. There are market
rumours of 1.2 million tonnes of stockpiling from the
market. At the same time, around 3 million tonnes of
new capacity is still in the pipeline for 2015.

changes in the nature of the Group’s principal
activities during the year.

Aluminum premiums and stocks
US Midwest premiums steadily rose and
achieved 24.0 US cents/lb by the end of December
2014.
European duty-unpaid primary ingots premium
grew from 400 to 430 US$/t at the end of
December 2014.
Premiums for aluminium in Asia, as reflected by
the CIF MJP, remained firm in 2014. The quarterly
CIF MJP indicator grew steadily from 255 to 256
USD/t in the first quarter of 2014 to 420 USD/t in
the fourth quarter of 2014.
Whilst aluminum premiums continue to be
supported by the deficit of metal supply in
certain regions including North America and
Europe, the premiums in Asia may come under
pressure from increasing Chinese aluminum

machine was installed. The complex is currently
performing tests with hot metal. Its capacity will
be of 120,000 tpa of 5XXX and 6XXX series of
slabs.
– SAZ increased the production of series 6XXX
billets of diameter 178 and 203 mm by 10,000
tpa.
– KhAZ initiated the production of AlSi7Mg casting
alloys. In 2014, 13,378 tonnes were produced
with a further increase after retrofitting to 82,000
tpa.
– The project to install annealing furnaces is close to
completion at IrkAZ for ensuring the production of
up to 3,000 tpa of AlZr of wire rod.
The wire rod production complex was
commissioned at KAZ. During start-up and
commissioning 801 tonnes of wire rod were
produced, including 22 tonnes of 6XXX alloy. New
alloys are being mastered. The complex capacity
will be 50,000 tpa.

DEVELOPMENT OF AN IN-HOUSE
TECHNOLOGY FOR PRIMARY ALUMINIUM
PRODUCTION:
– The implementation of the project to improve
high-amperage pot construction is in progress
in the SAZ pilot area: the rebuild of 16 RA-400
and RA-400T pots was completed; the useful life
of shutdown pots of 2,000 days was achieved;
– The project of conversion of C-2/3 Soederberg
pots to the RA-167 pre-bake technology is
ongoing at NkAZ: 5 pots, gas treatment unit and
feed unit were installed; target parameters were
achieved; 5 additional pots will be installed in
2015;
– The refining of ‘Green Soederberg’ technology
continues in the BrAZ pilot area: 46 pots were
equipped with an automatic raw materials feed
system and a centralised alumina distribution
system. In 2015, an automatic raw materials
feed system and a centralised alumina
distribution system will be installed on another
44 pots, cathode construction will be changed
on 14 pots during rebuild;
– The conversion of potrooms 3–6 to ‘Green
Soederberg’ technology is on going at KrAZ.
In 2015 conversion of potrooms 1-2, 9-23 will
begin.

USE OF NEW POTROOM VEHICLES:
– In 2014, Russian Engineering Company
(REC) manufactured and supplied new types
of pot treatment vehicles: an anode paste
loading machine, an end-wall crust breaker,
a rackraising machine, and a crust breaking
machine on pre-baked anode pots;
– A prototype model of a drive truck with an
electric motor unit was manufactured, and further
conversion to electric traction of all special
equipment of the reduction area is planned;

ENERGY EFFICIENCY:
–

–

–

Energy efficiency projects were successfully
implemented at all smelters of the Aluminium
Division. The implementation in 2014 of
energy efficiency actions facilitated a reduction
in the specific consumption of plant-wide
electric power at the production sites of the
Aluminium Division by 189 kWh/t compared
to 2013.
The main construction work in the area of
notching of anode blocks was completed in the
SAZ carbon shop; commissioning and start-up
of equipment and refining of technology are in
progress;
Successful tests of energy efficient pot designs
were completed in KrAZ, SAZ, and KhAZ
test areas for further replication at production
facilities of the Division.

HEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT (HSE):
– Production facilities of the Aluminium Division
confirmed the compliance of their respective
HSE management systems with OHSAS 18001
following an external audit by DNV;
– BrAZ and IrkAZ confirmed their compliance with
the ISO 14001 environmental management
standard.

2014; by the year end the building for production
of automotive components from aluminium by die
casting was reconstructed within the framework of
the operation of a joint venture with Israeli OMEN.
Nadvoitsy aluminium smelter : the dismantling of
equipment of potrooms 1-3 continued throughout
the year; potroom 4 is still operating; a set of
contracts allowing to combine the smelter and the
nearby Ondskaya HPP was signed to reduce the
cost of electric power for the smelter in the fourth
quarter of 2014: OHPP lease agreement, OHPP
operating agreement, lease agreement of IDGC
grids to connect the smelter with HPP and a number
of other ancillary contracts.
Bogoslovsk aluminium smelter : the dismantling
of potrooms of the first block was performed
throughout the year without potential re-start; the
Board of Directors agreed in September 2014
not to mothball the equipment of potline 6 and
by the end of the year the employees initiated the
dismantling of these capacities.
Volgograd aluminium smelter : the project for
remelting of solid metal (supplied from Siberian
smelter) into value-added products at the premises
of the smelter’s casthouse launched in December
2013 continued to operate successfully throughout
2014 within the framework of mothballing the
production area. In 2014 the smelter produced
46.8 thousand tonnes of finished products and 32.5
thousand tonnes of anode paste to be delivered to
Kandalaksha aluminium smelter.
KUBAL : The reduction of output in 2014
compared to 2013 was determined by the failure
of T32 transformer in February 2014 and the
consequent operation with low amperage and
repeated emergency de-energising of potline A.
In the course of the year, the process status of the
reduction area was stabilised and the potline was
not shut down for mothballing. The implementation of
the programme of retrofitting of the smelter’s power
supply system involving the combining of potlines
A and B and retirement of all units, which operated
for two useful lives, began by the end of 2014. The
system will provide for necessary redundancy, the
increase in the number of operating pots by 60 pots
and the possibility to increase amperage by 15 kA.

requiring longer repairs), introduction of

Coal production results
The aggregate coal production attributable to
the Company’s 50% share in LLP Bogatyr Komir
decreased by 9% to 19,001 kt in 2014, as
compared to 20,852 kt in 2013. The decrease in
volume in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due to
lower sales of coal to Russian customers resulting
from decreased regional demand and higher
competition, which was partially offset by increased
demand for coal in Kazakhstan.
Transportation results
The aggregate coal and other goods transported
by railway LLP Bogatyr Komir Trans attributable
to the Company’s 50% share decreased by 21%
to 6,730 kt in 2014, as compared to 8,543 kt
in 2013. The decrease in volume in 2014 as
compared to 2013 was due to a decrease in coal
delivery in Russia.

POWDERS:
The growth of production and sales of the
Powders business was ensured mainly by increasing
sales of value-added products (aluminium powder
and paste): in 2014 we managed not only to
consolidate the domestic market, but also to
develop new directions. Pastes of PM Shelekhov
consolidated in the Indonesian construction market,
which developed sales to the entire South-East
Asia region; the first industrial batch was sent to
the construction market from Volgograd. To boost
sales of fine powders in Asia, which increases its
share in the global market of solar energy year
after year, a contract was signed with the worldleading producer of metallisation pastes Giga Solar.
In 2014 the Commercial Department of the New
Projects Directorate arrived at mutually beneficial
terms of collabouration with Monocrystal for
delivery of VgAZ fine powders, which allowed the
Russian company to retain a significant share (15%)
in the global solar energy market in 2014 and
ensured increased profitability for VgAZ.
Production facilities are being retrofitted in
line with demand: the production technology of
44 new brands of products with improved quality
characteristics for the production of autoclaved
aerated concrete for the construction industry
were developed in 2014; the retrofitting of the
pulverisation system at SUAL-PM was completed.
SECONDARY ALLOYS
Increased production of secondary alloys
in 2014 compared to 2013 was achieved
by means of a set of measures aimed at
optimising production processes: optimisation
of utilisation of smelting complex equipment,
introduction of preventative maintenance

Sales of alumina

Sales of foil (USD

Revenue from sales of primary aluminium and
alloys decreased by USD336 million, or by 4.1%,
to USD7,823 million in 2014, as compared to
USD8,159 million in 2013, primarily due to a 6.9%
decrease in volumes of the primary aluminium and
alloys sold as a result of completion of the inefficient
capacity curtailment programme. The decrease
was mostly offset by the growth in weightedaverage realised aluminium price by 3.0% in 2014
as compared to 2013, due to the improved LME
aluminium price performance, as well as a 42.3%
growth in premiums above the LME price in the
different geographical segments (to an average of
USD380 per tonne from USD267 per tonne for the
years 2014 and 2013, respectively).
Revenue from sales of alumina increased by USD62
million or by 12.2% to USD569 million for the year
ended 31 December 2014 as compared to USD507
million for the previous year. The increase was mostly
attributable to a 9.3% growth in sales volumes.

Revenue from sales of foil decreased by 3.2%
to USD303 million in 2014, as compared to
USD313 million in 2013, primarily due to a 5.4%
decrease in the weighted average sales price,
partially compensated by a 2.3% increase in sales
volumes.
Revenue from other sales, including sales of other
products, bauxite and energy services decreased
by 15.2% to USD662 million for the year ended 31
December 2014 as compared to USD781 million
for the previous year, due to a 26.3% decrease in
sales of bauxite and a 12.4% decrease in sales of

Total cost of sales decreased by USD1,206
million, or by 14.3%, to USD7,223 million in
2014, as compared to USD8,429 million in
2013. The decrease was primarily driven by the
6.9% reduction (or 263 thousand tonnes) in the
aggregate aluminium sales volumes following the
completion of the capacity curtailment programme
at the least efficient smelters as well as the significant
depreciation of the Russian Ruble and Ukrainian
Hryvna against the US Dollar.
The cost of alumina decreased in the reporting
period (as compared to 2013) by 14.0%, primarily
as a result of a decrease in alumina purchase
volumes.
The cost of bauxite was almost flat during 2014
(as compared to 2013).
The cost of raw materials (other than alumina and
bauxite) and other costs decreased by 12.8% due
to the lower raw materials purchase price (such as
raw petroleum coke by 10.4%, calcined petroleum
coke by 18.1%, raw pitch coke by 34.9%, pitch by
19.3%) and lower purchase volumes in 2014 as
compared to 2013.
The energy cost decreased in 2014 by 18.7% to
USD1,929 million compared to USD2,374 million
in 2013 primarily due to the decrease in aggregate
aluminium sales volumes and depreciation of the
Russian Ruble against the US Dollar.

aggregate aluminium sales volumes supported by
the depreciation of the Russian Ruble against the US
Dollar within the comparable periods.
Administrative expenses decreased by 6.2% to
USD605 million in 2014, compared to USD645
million in 2013 primarily as a result of the
depreciation of the Russian Ruble against the US
Dollar within the comparable periods.
Impairment of non-current assets and restructuring
expenses decreased by USD1,816 million in 2014
to USD103 million due to impairment charges and
restructuring expenses recognized by the Company
in the aggregate amount of USD1,919 million for
the year ended 31 December 2013. For details

Share of profits/(losses) of joint ventures

The Company’s share in the profits of associates for
the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013 totalled
USD500 million and USD84 million, respectively.
The Company’s share in the results of associates in
both periods resulted primarily from the profit from
the Company’s investment in Norilsk Nickel, which
amounted to USD515 million and USD105 million for
2014 and 2013, respectively.
The Company’s share of the profits of joint ventures
was USD36 million for the year ended 31 December
2014 as compared to losses of USD551 million for the
same period in 2013. This represents the Company’s
share of the results of the Company’s joint ventures
— BEMO, LLP Bogatyr Komir, Mega Business and
Alliance (transportation business in Kazakhstan) and
North United Aluminium Shenzhen Co., Ltd.
The Company’s share of losses in joint ventures
for the year ended 31 December 2013 includes
impairment losses relating to property, plant
and equipment of the BEMO project entities the Boguchansky Aluminium Smelter and the
Boguchanskaya Hydro Power Plant. The Group
recognised its share of impairment losses in the
BEMO project entities to the extent of its investment
in the corresponding entity and made the necessary
adjustments to the carrying values of each investment.
The Group’s share of losses related to BOGES and
BoAZ were recognized in an amount of USD352
million and USD248 million, respectively. The loss
related to BoAZ was recognised to the extent of the
Group’s investment. At 31 December 2013, additional
losses of USD309 million related to impairment
charges have not been recognised because the
Group’s investment has been fully written down to nil.

On the date of disposal the Group recycled
USD230 million of accumulated foreign currency
translation losses and USD4 million of other losses
relating to shares sold from other comprehensive
income recognized as equity in the statement
of income. The accumulated foreign currency
translation losses of USD230 million and USD4
million of other losses were accumulated while the
shares were recognized as part of the Group’s
investment in an associate.
PROFIT/(LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAX
UC RUSAL incurred a profit before income tax of
USD147 million for the year ended 31 December
2014, as compared to a loss before income tax of
USD3,241 million for the year ended 31 December
2013 for the reasons set out above.
INCOME TAX
Income tax increased by USD157 million to
USD238 million in 2014, as compared to USD81
million in 2013.
Current tax expenses decreased by USD32
million, or 17.7%, to USD149 million for the year
ended 31 December 2014, as compared to
USD181 million for the previous year mainly due
to the tax paid on the cumulative intergroup transfer
of Norilsk Nickel dividends in 2013 partially
compensated through tax losses accumulated for
prior years.
The same factor drove the increase in deferred
tax expenses to USD89 million in 2014 as
compared to a deferred tax benefit of USD100
million in 2013. The deferred tax expense for

net effective share in Norilsk Nickel results. The
improvements in Adjusted and Recurring Results

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
UC RUSAL’s total assets decreased by
USD5,623 million, or 27.5% to USD14,857
million as at 31 December 2014 as compared to
USD20,480 million as at 31 December 2013. The
decrease in total assets mainly resulted from the
decrease in the carrying value of the investment in
Norilsk Nickel.
Total liabilities decreased by USD1,310 million,
or 9.4%, to USD12,620 million as at 31 December
2014 as compared to USD13,930 million as at 31
December 2013. The decrease was mainly due to
the decrease in the outstanding debt of the Group.

The abovementioned factors allowed the
Company to assign USD640 million of its own cash
flows for the debt repayment that together with the
interest payments of USD677 million represent the
main components of the cash used in the financing
activities with a total amount of USD1,900 million
for 2014.

The Company generated net cash from operating
activities of USD1,398 million for the year ended
31 December 2014 as compared to USD408
for the previous year. The net increase in working
capital and provisions amounted to USD29 million
for 2014 as compared to USD173 million for the
previous year.
Net cash generated from investment activities for
2014 decreased to USD514 million as compared
to USD978 million for 2013 primarily due to
proceeds from the disposal of Norilsk Nickel shares
to Crispian Investments Limited in the previous year.
The decrease was partially compensated with
the 10% or USD81 million increase in dividends
received from Norilsk Nickel in the amount of
USD884 million for 2014 as compared to USD803
million for the prior year.

SEGMENT REPORTING
The Group has four reporting segments, as
described in the annual report of the Company,
which are the Group’s strategic business units:

Key Events
• In February 2014 the Group entered into a
USD400 million prepayment facility agreement
with Glencore AG for the supply of alumina
from one of the Group’s subsidiaries to
Glencore AG for the period 2014-2016.
Interest of 3M Libor + 4.95% and principal
payable under the facility agreement will, to the
extent such amounts are due, be offset against
amounts due by Glencore AG under its alumina
supply contract at USD40 per metric tonne
for the first six months and USD286 per metric
tonne thereafter. The facility is to be repaid on
or before 31 December 2016 in accordance
with an agreed amortisation schedule which
commenced on 30 September 2014.
• On 25 February 2014 RUSAL Bratsk entered into
a bond sale agreement for the purpose of selling
up to 5,000,000 (five million) series 07 bonds
which were expected to be bought back under
a put-option on 3 March 2014. The selling price
under the terms of bonds sale agreement was
RUB998.356, or 99.8356% of the par value
of each bond. Simultaneously United Company
RUSAL Aluminium Limited entered into a putoption transaction which may be exercised for
up to 5,000,000 (five million) series 07 bonds
at a strike price which will be a function of the
announced coupon rate, purchase price, tenor
and the expected yield of the transaction, and is
exercisable on 22 February 2016.
• On 26 February 2014, the Group and
Sberbank entered into an amendment
agreement to a non-revolving credit facility
agreement dated 1 December 2011 in order
to increase the credit limit by RUB2.4 billion
from RUB18.3 billion to RUB20.7 billion. This
allowed the Group to fulfil its obligations under
the put option of Ruble bonds issued by OJSC
RUSAL Bratsk (series 07), which was due for
repayment on 3 March 2014.

• On 28 February 2014 RUSAL Bratsk announced
a coupon rate in respect of the series 07 bond
issue of 12% per annum for the 7-10 semiannual coupon periods.
• On 3 March 2014 RUSAL Bratsk successfully
performed its obligations under the terms of
bondholders’ put-option. As result of the putoption being exercised RUB10,947,149
series 07 bonds (about 73% of the issue) were
repurchased by the issuer. As of 31 December
2014 6,462,455 series 07 bonds and
8,120,893 series 08 bonds were outstanding
(traded in the market).The closing market price
on 31 December 2014 was RUB963.4 and
RUB964 per bond for the first and second
tranches, respectively.
• In March 2014 the Group refinanced its credit
facilities with Gazprombank in the amount of
USD242.7 million and EUR74.7 million. The
facilities bear interest at 3M LIBOR + 6.5% and
with a maturity date of 5 years from drawdown.
• In August 2014 the amendment and restatement
agreement relating to the refinancing of the
USD4.75 billion PXF facility agreement and
the USD400 million multicurrency PXF facility
agreement was signed and became effective.
Pursuant to the Amendments, the two PXF facilities
were combined into a single facilities agreement
with the agreement now comprising:
(A) One tranche comprising tranche A of the
previous USD4.75 billion PXF facility and both
tranches of the previous USD400 million facility
which amounts to USD2.5616 billion which is to be
repaid in equal quarterly instalments starting from
the 12 January 2016 with a final maturity date on
31 December 2018.
Loans under this tranche bear interest at the rate
of 3-month LIBOR plus margin (cash + PIK) based
on the Total Net Debt/EBIDTA ratio which is set
quarterly. Such interest will be paid or capitalised,
as the case may be, quarterly.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

AND ANALYSIS

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

• As of 31 December 2014 the Total Net Debt
to Covenant EBITDA ratio (the leverage ratio)
was below 4.5x. Since interest rates under PXF
credit facilities are linked to the leverage ratio
it allowed the Company to decrease the cash
and PIK margin under Tranche A of USD4.75
billion syndicated facility and USD400 million
multicurrency credit facility by 1% in total (0.25%
in cash and 0.75% in PIK respectively) and
the PIK Margin under a second tranche which
comprises the refinanced tranche B under the
USD4.75 billion syndicated facility by 0.75% in
PIK starting from 03 March 2015.

Liquidity
In 2014, the Group’s principal source of liquidity
was operating cashflow of USD1,398 million.
The Group’s principal uses of cash through 2014
are expected to be for operating expenses, debt
repayment and capital expenditure. It expects to fund
its liquidity needs mainly through operating cash flow.
Equity and Debt Raisings
There were no equity raisings and/or allotments
and issues of equity during 2014.

Dividends
• The Company’s ability to pay dividends
is limited to the period when the financial
covenants, including the leverage ratio, meet
the required thresholds. For the leverage ratio
the required level is 3.5:1 (with the maximum
permitted payment of dividends limited to
25% of net profit). A reduction in the leverage
ratio to 3.0:1 (and below) will allow the
Company to pay up to 50% of its net profit as
distributions to shareholders.

Cash flows
In 2014, the Company used its USD1,398
million of net cash generated from operating
activities, and USD926 million in dividends from
associates and joint ventures, predominantly to
make debt repayments (comprising net repayment
of USD640 million), to pay interest (USD677
million) and on total capital expenditure (USD479
million).
The following table summarises the Company’s
cash flows for 2014 and 2013:

The abovementioned initiatives allowed the
Company to assign USD640 million of its own cash
flows for the debt repayment that together with the
interest payments of USD677 million represent the main
components of the cash used in the financing activities
with a total amount of USD1,900 million for 2014.

The Company generated net cash from operating
activities of USD1,398 million for the year ended
31 December 2014 as compared to USD408
million for the previous year. The net increase in
working capital and provisions amounted to USD29
million for 2014 as compared to USD173 million
for the previous year.
Net cash generated from investment activities
for 2014 decreased to USD514 million as
compared to USD978 million for 2013, primarily
due to proceeds from the disposal of Norilsk
Nickel shares to Crispian Investments Limited in the
previous year.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents included USD13
million of restricted cash for letters of credit entered
into with banks as at 31 December 2014 and
USD15 million as at 31 December 2013. Note

Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency
risks on sales, purchases and borrowings that are
denominated in a currency other than the respective
functional currencies of the Group. Foreign
exchange risk management is aimed at protecting
the projected profit and cash generated in the
normal course of business from foreign exchange
rate movements.
As at the end of 2014 over 90% of the Group’s
credit portfolio was USD denominated. The credit
portfolio structure matches the general structure of
generated cash flows.
To minimize foreign currency exposure with
respect to its Ruble - UNIVERSAL denominated
borrowings, the Group has entered into the number
of cross-currency swap transactions:
In 2011 the Group entered into cross-currency
swap transactions to convert two tranches of its
rouble bonds with the total notional amount of
RUB30 billion into USD denominated liability of
USD1,063 million.
In February 2012 – May 2012 and in
August 2013 the Group entered into a number
of cross-currency swaps to convert 5 year rouble
denominated credit in the amount of RUB18.3
billion into USD denominated liability of USD598
million.
On 31 December 2014 the Group recognised
a loss on the part of the instruments as they were
considered ineffective. The reasons for this were
partial buy-back of bonds in relation to the second
tranche, and change of maturity date for RUB18.3
facility as a result of refinancing.
A detailed description of the Group’s interest
rate and foreign exchange risks is set out in note
31(c) of the consolidated financial statements for the
year ended 31 December 2014.

FINANCIAL RATIOS
Gearing
The Group’s gearing ratio, which is the ratio
of total debts (including both long-term and shortterm borrowings and bonds outstanding) to the total
assets, as at 31 December 2014 and 31 December
2013 was 63.3% and 52.9%, respectively.
Return on Equity
The Group’s return on equity, which is the
amount of net profit as a percentage of total equity,
as at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013
was 4.1% and (50.7%), respectively.
Interest Coverage Ratio
The Group’s interest coverage ratio, which is
the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to net
interest, for the years ended 31 December 2014 and
31 December 2013 was 1.2 and (3.3), respectively.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Group is exposed in the ordinary course
of its business to risks related to changes in interest
rates and foreign exchange rates.
The Group’s policy is to monitor and measure
interest rate and foreign currency risk and to
undertake steps to limit their influence on the
Group’s performance.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk due
to the fact that a significant portion of its long-term
borrowings is LIBOR based floating-rate facilities. The
key point of interest rate risk management is to reach
a reasonable balance between floating rate and
fixed rate facilities. One of the balancing instruments
used by the Company is interest rate swaps.
In order to hedge against interest rate
fluctuations under the 1 year LIBOR based floating
rate Sberbank facility with the total outstanding
amount of USD3.82 billion as of 31 December
2014 the Group entered into an interest rate swap.
The swap is effective from 30 September 2012.
As result of the swap transaction, the 1 year LIBOR
based floating rate was converted into a fixed rate
of 2.4795%. The notional amount of the swap
transaction is USD3.3 billion.

corporate code of conduct strictly prohibits
discrimination based on gender, race and/or
religion and forbids any form of child, forced
or indentured labour.
Due to the difficult economic situation, it was
decided to stop financing the corporate voluntary
medical insurance programme from 1 January
2014 for all employees working at the Group’s
facilities in the Russian Federation. However, the
Company gives employees the opportunity to buy
insurance policies at their own expense at the
corporate discounted price.
As part of the project to automate and
standardise employee data and cost accounting
processes, installation of the standard
configuration 1C 8: Payroll and HR Management
software at the Company’s sites in Russia was
continued in 2014. As of the end of 2014,
the software was installed at about 90% of the
Company’s sites in Russia.

REMUNERATION AND BENEFIT POLICIES
The remuneration paid by the Group to an
employee is based on his or her qualifications
and performance, as well as the complexity
of his or her job. Wages for employees are
generally reviewed annually and are revised
in accordance with a performance assessment
and local labour market conditions. Annual
salary reviews covering main labour markets
are unaudited for this purpose. Under the
current collective employment agreement the
remuneration of employees of the Group's
production sites is subject to an annual increase
offsetting inflation on the basis of the official data
published by the State Statistics Committee of
the Russian Federation regarding the minimum
living wage for people who have a job and the
consolidated index of consumer prices.
The Group's Personnel Policy and corporate
code of conduct govern the relationship
52

About 60% of the Group’s employees are
unionised and 90% of employees are covered
by collective bargaining agreements. In addition,
labour relations and benefits at Russian production
facilities are regulated by an industrial tariff
agreement for Russian mining and metallurgical
enterprises which has been amended as follows:
• according to the changes in the Labour Code
which took effect from 1 January 2014 under the
Federal Law 421F3 dated 28 December 2013
relating to the Special Assessment of Working
Conditions relevant compensation and benefits are
to be provided to employees working in places with
harmful levels of exposure;
• the minimum salary of employees working at
places relating to core production and non-core
production has been increased up to 1.7 and
1.2 times the official costs of living in the Russian
Federation respectively.
CHANGES TO THE ORGANISATIONAL
STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY
Due to the shut down and preservation of aluminium
production at some sites of the Aluminium Division West
and in order to organize alternative production on the
sites preserved for development of domestic aluminium
consumption, the Aluminium Division West was renamed
the New Projects Directorate. The relevant structural
changes were made, including the transfer of the
ALSCON aluminium site from the Technical Directorate.
Aiming to optimize business processes and redistribute
management functions of the Group’s structural units the
Aluminium Division East was renamed the Aluminium
Division in January 2014. The Branch of OJSC “SUAL”KAZ was transferred from the Aluminium Division West
to the Aluminium Division.
Together with structural changes aiming to increase
efficiency the refineries situated in Guinea and Australia
were transferred from the Procurement and Logistics
Directorate to the Alumina Division in October 2014.
In order to strengthen the sales markets
development function and increase sales in Asia,
Russia and the CIS the organisational structure of the
Sales Directorate was changed.

The following special programms and projects
for the development of staff at the production
facilities of the Group have been implemented:
• the ‘Successors Development Programme’;
• ‘RUSAL’s Professionals’, a professional skills
contest concerned with the development of
leadership skills;
• ‘Improvement of the Year’, the third contest
aimed at the personnel involvement in the
production system development;
• the ‘RUSAL’s Manager Standard’ program renewal;
• start of an training simulators program by
building and installing the first of them and
building five more;
• training on the Quality Management System;
• training of expert engineers in respect of the
Company’s facilities;
• carrying out of the target program for a group
of students from the Siberian Federal University
(SFU) and Irkutsk Federal Technical University in
‘Non-Ferrous Metals’ specialisation
and start of the target program new groups of
students:
– from SFU in the ‘Non-Ferrous Metals’
specialisation
– from the Irkutsk Federal Technical University in
the ‘Non-Ferrous Metals’ specialization
– from the Ural State Mining University in the
‘Mining Engineer’ specialisation
• a training program for qualified personnel in
relation to the Company’s foreign facilities
(which so far has involved the training of 100
Guinean citizens at four Russian universities);
• the development of modular programms of
mandatory training for workers;
• the development of professional standards for
key positions, including the launch of a project
on the development of the Competence
Model for managers of production sites.
BONUS AND SHARE INCENTIVES
On 11 May 2011, the Board adopted the
LTIP, in which eligible participants (employees of
the Group) may be entitled to participate. From
the pool of eligible participants, the Board may, at
its discretion, select employees for participation in
the LTIP. The number of shares to be awarded to a
selected employee is determined by the Company
on the “Award Date” (as determined in the LTIP
Rules). Unless otherwise determined by the Board,
at its sole discretion, and with the exception of the
vesting of the CEO’s LTIP Award, the awarded
shares and related income for the particular award
period (“LTIP Award”) that are transferable to
a selected employee are paid to that selected
employee in installments (each comprising 20% of
the total LTIP Award), over a five year period (each
a “Tranche”), provided that:

TRAINING SCHEMES
In 2014, the Company’s key focus areas in the field
of personnel development and training were as follows:
• professional training of operators;
• mandatory training programms for senior
management and engineers;
• training programms for the Company’s external
candidate pool, in cooperation with educational
institutions, at all education levels.

• the selected employee remains an employee at
all times following the Award Date and on each
of the LTIP Award vesting dates; and
• the first Tranche of each LTIP Award will vest
on the vesting date during the calendar year
immediately following the award period for
which such LTIP Award is awarded.
During 2014, the Board did not approve any
LTIP Award for 2013 and, therefore, no Shares
were granted under the 2013 LTIP Award.
Out of those shares conditionally granted under
the 2010 LTIP Award, the fourth tranche of the shares
vested in November 2014 comprised 1,343,514
shares. For the year ended 31 December 2014, Elian
Employee Benefit Trustee Limited, as trustee of the
United Company RUSAL Plc Employee Benefit Trust
and the LTIP (“Trustee”) acquired a total of 1,750,886
shares with a nominal value of USD0.01 per share.
The purchased share represent approximately
0.0115% of the Company’s issued share capital as at
31 December 2014 and at the Latest Practicable Date.
In June 2013, the Board decided to approve
the establishment of the PSIP, an employee share
award plan aimed at rewarding the Company’s
employees for achievements in the Production
System implementation.
The PSIP is a one-off share award plan and its
objectives are:
• to increase the employees’ commitment to the
achievement of the Group’s strategic goals in
implementing the Production System;
• to share the Group’s success with employees;
• to recognize contributions made by certain
employees in implementing the Production System;
• to enhance the alignment of the interests of the
employees with those of the shareholders.
No new shares of the Company were issued for
the purposes of the Plan. The maximum number of
shares awarded under the PSIP does not exceed
0.05% of the total number of issued shares as at the
date of the Award.
The Company, in accordance with the PSIP rules,
selected employee(s) for participation in the PSIP (the
“Employee”). The Directors of the Company or other
connected persons are not eligible for participation
in the PSIP.
The shares awarded under the PSIP that are
transferable to an Employee will vest each year over
3 (three) years.
In July 2014, there were 2,006,218 shares
vested in the participants of the PSIP.
Neither LTIP nor the PSIP constitute a share option
scheme or an arrangement analogous to a share option
scheme for the purpose of Chapter 17 of the Listing Rules.
BUSINESS RISKS
The Company has identified the following risks
which affect its business:

• The Group operates in a cyclical industry that
has recently experienced price and demand
volatility, which has had and may continue to
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
performance and financial results.
• The Group’s competitive position in the
global aluminium industry is highly dependent
on continued access to inexpensive and
uninterrupted electricity supply, in particular,
long-term contracts for such electricity. Increased
electricity prices (particularly as a result of
deregulation of electricity tariffs), as well as
interruptions in the supply of electricity, could
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of
operations.
• The Group depends on the provision of
uninterrupted transportation services and access
to state-owned infrastructure for the transportation
of its materials and end products across significant
distances, and the prices for such services
(particularly rail tariffs) could increase.
• The terms of the credit facility agreements impose
certain limits on the Group’s capital expenditure
and payment of dividends. Failure by the Group
to comply with the terms and conditions of these
agreements may materially adversely affect the
Group and its Shareholders.
• The Group benefits significantly from its low
effective tax rate, and changes to the Group’s
tax position may increase the Group’s tax
liability and affect its cost structure.
• The Group is exposed to foreign currency
fluctuations which may affect its financial results.
• En+ is able to influence the outcome of important
decisions relating to the Group’s business, which
includes transactions with certain related parties.
• The Group depends on the services of key
senior management personnel and the strategic
guidance of Mr. Oleg Deripaska.
• Adverse media speculation, claims and other
public statements could adversely affect the
value of the Shares.
• The Group’s business may be affected by labour
disruptions, shortages of skilled labour and
labour cost inflation.
• The Group relies on third-party suppliers for
certain materials.
• Equipment failures or other difficulties may result
in production curtailments or shutdowns.
• The Group is subject to certain requirements
under Russian anti-monopoly laws.
• The Group operates in an industry that gives rise
to health, safety and environmental risks.
• Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources data are
estimates only and are inherently uncertain, and
such Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources may
be depleted more rapidly than anticipated.
• The Group’s licenses and concession rights
to explore and mine Ore Reserves may be

CONTINGENCIES
The Board has reviewed and considered the
contingent liabilities of the Company and disclosed
information concerning such contingent liabilities
in note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, for detailed information about
contingent liabilities, please refer to note 33 to the
consolidated financial statements. Details of the
amounts of provisions are also disclosed in note 28
to the consolidated financial statements.
Tax contingencies
New transfer pricing legislation was introduced
in Russia from 1 January 2012 which applies to
cross-border transactions between the Group
companies in and out of Russia and to certain
domestic related parties’ transactions in Russia
exceeding a certain annual threshold (RUB1 billion
from 2014). The new legislation brings local transfer
pricing rules closer to OECD guidelines, however
creates additional immediate uncertainty in their
application and interpretation. Since there is no
practice of applying the new rules by the Russian
tax authorities and the pre-existing practice and
case law is of little reliance, it is difficult to predict
the effect, if any, of the new transfer pricing rules on
the consolidated financial statements. The Company
nevertheless believes it is compliant with the new
rules as it has historically applied the OECD-based
transfer pricing principles to the relevant transactions
in Russia.
The new controlled foreign company (“CFC”)
rules have been introduced in Russia starting from
1 January 2015. The rules apply to undistributed
profits of non-Russian CFC controlled by Russian taxresident shareholders. The Company is tax-resident
in Cyprus and managed and controlled from Cyprus
and the new CFC rules shall not directly apply
to the Group in relation to any of its non-Russian
affiliates. The CFC rules may apply to Russian taxresident controlling shareholders of the Company,
where such shareholder controls more than 50% of
the Company (starting from 2016 more than 25%
or 10% where all Russian tax-resident shareholders
together control more than 50%). The rules also
introduce certain reporting requirements for such
Russian tax-resident controlling shareholders of
the Company starting from 2015 in relation to
non-Russian affiliates of the Group where such
shareholders directly or indirectly control more than
10% of those affiliates.

INTERESTS IN ASSOCIATED AND JOINT
VENTURES
As at the Latest Practicable Date, the Group
owns an interest of 27.82% in the share capital of
Norilsk Nickel. In addition, the Group is a party to
certain material joint venture agreements through
which it owns the following:
– a 20% equity interest in QAL;
– a 50% equity interest in the companies
comprising BEMO;
– a 50% equity interest in LLP Bogatyr Komir;
– a 50% equity interest in the transportation
business;
– a 33% equity interest in North United Aluminium;
and
– a 50% equity interest in VolkhOR.
The Group’s interest in joint ventures was
USD409 million as at 31 December 2014,
compared to USD585 million as at 31 December
2013. For additional information on the Group’s
interests in associates and joint ventures, please refer
to notes 18 and 19 to the consolidated financial
statements.
55

AND ANALYSIS

Legal contingencies
The Group’s business activities expose it
to a variety of lawsuits and claims which are
monitored, assessed and contested on an
ongoing basis. Where management believes
that a lawsuit or claim would result in the outflow
of the economic benefits for the Group, a best
estimate of such outflow is included in provisions
in the consolidated financial statements (refer to
note 28 of the consolidated financial statements).
As at 31 December 2014, the amount of claims,
where management assess outflows as possible,
approximate USD111 million (31 December
2013: USD175 million).
In January 2013, the Company received a
writ of summons and statement of claim filed in
the High Court of Justice of the Federal Capital
Territory of Nigeria (Abuja) by plaintiff BFIG
Group Divino Corporation ( “BFIG”) against
certain subsidiaries of the Company. It is a claim
for damages arising out of the defendants’
alleged tortious interference in the bid process
for the sale of the Nigerian government ’s
majority stake in the ALSCON and alleged
loss of BFIG’s earnings resulting from its failed
bid for the said stake in ALSCON. BFIG seeks
compensatory damages in the amount of
USD2.8 billion plus interest. The Company does
not expect the case to have any material adverse
effect on the Group’ s financial position or its
operation as a whole. The Company has filed its
statement of defence and witness statements in
support of its legal position. The next hearing is
scheduled for 14 May 2015.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

LLC, OJSC RUSAL SAYANAL, OJSC “Ural Foil”,
UC RUSAL Energoset LLC and OJSC “South Ural
Cryolite Plant” enter into, from time to time as
part of their ordinary course of business, shortterm electricity and capacity supply contracts
not exceeding three years with CJSC MAREM+,
a company controlled by En+, for the supply of
electricity and capacity purchased at the wholesale
energy and capacity market.
The purchase of electricity and capacity on the
wholesale market is effected at a price which is
determined daily (for electricity) and monthly (for
capacity), based on trading results on the wholesale
market, and subject to unpredictable external
fluctuations (including, without limitation, weather
factors, river stream flow rates, hydro-power plant
output storage, transborder cross-flow planning,
provision for reserves by power generation facilities,
scheduled equipment repairs, fuel price fluctuations,
details of fuel regime for “endpoint” power
generation facilities, economic efficiency of bids
submitted by producers, technological processes of
power generation facilities’ equipment, and effect
of state regulation on the market model). The price
under these contracts is derived from the wholesale
market price regulated under the regulations of
the Russian Government. Payments are effected
by tentatively scheduled instalments during each
month, with the final payment effected in the middle
of the month following the month of billing. The
consideration was satisfied in cash via wire transfer.
During 2014, members of the Group have
from time to time entered into short-term electricity
and capacity supply contracts with LLC “Irkutskaya
Energosbytovaya Company” (“Irkutskenergosbyt
LLC”), a company controlled by En+ as to more
than 30%, for the supply of electricity and capacity
purchased on the wholesale electricity market and
supplied to the consumers in the retail market on
normal commercial terms (including the pricing
terms) regulated under the regulations of the Russian
Government. Payment under each of these contracts is
made by installments during each month of supply. The
consideration was satisfied in cash via wire transfer.
The actual monetary value of electricity
and capacity purchased for the year ended
31 December 2014 under the contracts with
Irkutskenergo, LLC “Avtozavodskaya CHP”,
Krasnoyarskaya HPP CJSC MAREM+ and
Irkutskenergosbyt LLC was USD167.6 million.

The consideration under such miscellaneous
electricity and capacity transmission contracts shall
follow the tariffs stipulated by the Tariff Service of the
Irkutsk region (an executive authority of the Irkutsk
region in the sphere of government regulation of
tariffs including electricity and capacity transmission
tariffs), and on terms which are uniform for all
consumers (tariffs are differentiated depending
on voltage levels). The consideration under these
contracts is satisfied in cash via wire transfer.
The actual monetary value of electricity and
capacity transmission purchased and sold for
the year ended 31 December 2014 under these
contracts with companies controlled by En+ was
USD169.6 million.
The aggregate consideration for the longterm and short-term electricity and capacity supply
contracts together with the miscellaneous electricity
and capacity transmission contracts between the
Group and the associates of En+ for the year ended
31 December 2014 was USD530.5 million, which
is within the annual cap of USD1,016 million (net of
VAT) as approved by the independent shareholders
of the Company for such type of continuing connected
transactions for the year ended 31 December 2014.
B Aluminium Sale Contracts
Members of the Group have from time to
time entered into aluminium sales contracts
with associates of Mr. Oleg Deripaska (“Mr.
Deripaska”). Based on additional information
received by the Company, there were no reasons
to deem OJSC KUMZ as a connected person of the
Company during 2014 and onwards.
Aluminium Sales Contracts with Mr. Deripaska’s
Associates
Mr. Deripaska, an Executive Director of the
Company, indirectly controls more than 30% of each
of (i) LLC Tradecom, (ii) LLC KraMZ, (iii) DOZAKL, (iv)
members of the group of Open Joint Stock Company
“GAZ” (the “GAZ Group”) including LLC GAZ,
“GAZ Group Autocomponents” LLC, OJSC “UMZ”,
JSC AVTODIZEL, JSC “URAL Motor Vehicles Plant”,
and (v) OJSC “Plant MOSMEK” (formerly known
as Glavstroy-MOSMEK). Each of these companies
is therefore an associate of Mr. Deripaska. As such,
the transactions between members of the Group
and LLC Tradecom, LLC KraMZ, DOZAKL, members
of the GAZ Group including LLC GAZ, “GAZ
Group Autocomponents” LLC, OJSC “UMZ”, JSC
AVTODIZEL and JSC “URAL Motor Vehicles Plant”,
OJSC “Plant MOSMEK” and Barnaultransmash,
discussed below, constitute continuing connected
transactions of the Company under the Listing Rules.
As Barnaultransmash ceased to be a connected
person in 2013, it ceased to be an associate of Mr.
Deripaska and transactions with Barnaultransmash
in 2014 would not be constituted as continuing
connected transactions of the Company.

Miscellaneous electricity and capacity transmission
contracts
The Group has also entered into miscellaneous
electricity and capacity transmission contracts
with “Irkutsk Electronetwork Company” OJSC
( “IENC”) being a company controlled by En+
as to more than 30% of its issued share capital,
from time to time during the year ended 31
December 2014.

15 DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN BUSINESSES
THAT MAY COMPETE WITH THE COMPANY
Mr. Deripaska, Ms. Gulzhan Moldazhanova,
Mr. Maxim Sokov, Ms. Olga Mashkovskaya and
Mr. Vladislav Soloviev were interested in/were
directors of En+, Mr. Len Blavatnik was interested in
SUAL Partners, Mr. Ivan Glasenberg was interested
in Glencore and was a Director and the Chief
Executive Officer of Glencore. En+, SUAL Partners
and Glencore are businesses which compete or
are likely to compete, either directly or indirectly,
with the Company. The summary below provides
a description of these businesses, as well as facts
demonstrating that the Group is capable of carrying
on its own business independently of and at arm’s
length from these businesses.
In considering whether the Board and senior
management of the Company are independent
from the senior management of each of En+, SUAL
Partners and Glencore, the Directors have taken
into account the following general reasons, as well
as the specific reasons applicable to each of En+,
SUAL Partners and Glencore:
(a) the Board consists of eighteen Directors,
comprising four executive Directors, nine nonexecutive Directors and five independent nonexecutive Directors;
(b) the decision-making mechanism of the Board set
out in the Articles of Association provides that all
Directors with a conflicting interest shall not vote
when a conflicted resolution is to be discussed
and voted on;
(c) the Board has five independent non-executive
Directors with extensive corporate governance
and financial experience and is able to review,
enhance and implement measures to manage any
conflict of interests between the businesses in which
the Directors have interests and the Group in order
to protect minority shareholders’ interests and to
manage the affairs of the Group independently
of the businesses in which the Directors have
interests that may compete with the Company.
The independent non-executive Directors make
recommendations on proposed connected
transactions by the Company. A committee of the

independent non-executive Directors will make
recommendations to the independent shareholders
on how to vote for any resolution that relates to
future connected transactions pursuant to the
Listing Rules’ requirements; and
(d) all connected transactions which are subject to
reporting and announcement requirements under
the Listing Rules have to be reviewed by the Audit
Committee before they are approved by the Board.
In respect of each specific relevant business:
A. En+
En+ is a limited liability company incorporated
under the laws of Jersey with its registered office
at 44, Esplanade, St. Helier, Jersey, JE4 9WG,
Channel Islands. En+ is ultimately controlled by
one of its beneficial owners Mr. Deripaska, who
indirectly holds 91.6% of the shares in En+.
En+’s strategy is to focus on businesses with
mining expertise, including in relation to the
extraction of raw materials for energy production,
electricity generation and the production of nonferrous metals. En+ specialises in metals that require
high energy consumption and then looks for
synergies between its energy producing and energy
consuming businesses.
En+’s origins lie in its core business of aluminium
production. Apart from being the Company’s
Controlling Shareholder, En+ also owns more than
30% in Krasnoyarsk Metallurgical Plant (“KraMZ”),
a plant which produces semi-finished aluminium
alloys and extrusion products.
Independence from En+
Having considered all relevant factors,
including the following, the Directors are
satisfied that the Group can conduct its business
independently of En+:

Independence of the Board and the Group’s
Senior Management from the Senior Management
of En+
The majority of the Board currently comprises
non-executive Directors due to a historical
arrangement between En+, SUAL Partners,
Glencore and Onexim, pursuant to which
they are each entitled to nominate a certain
number of candidates for appointment as
Directors. As at the Latest Practicable Date,
nine of the Directors were nominated by En+.
Four of Directors are also directors of En+. The
overlapping Directors at the Latest Practicable
Date were Mr. Deripaska (being Executive
Director) and Mr. Sokov, Ms. Mashkovskaya
and Ms. Moldazhanova (being non-executive
Directors). All of the overlapping Directors have
been elected on the basis of their qualifications
and breadth of experience, as set out in further
details in the “ Profiles of Directors and Senior
Management” section in this Annual Report.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

Other than as disclosed, as at 31 December
2014, neither any Director or the Chief Executive
Officer had any interest or short position, whether
beneficial or non-beneficial, in the Shares,
underlying Shares and debentures of the Company
or in any of its associated corporations (within
the meaning of Part XV of the SFO) which were
notified to the Company or the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange and entered into the register required
to be kept under section 352 of the SFO, or which
were notified to the Company and the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange pursuant to the Model Code.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

The Company ’s non-executive Directors attend
Board meetings and provide guidance to and
decide on the Company ’s important matters.
Certain non-executive Directors also sit on the
committees of the Board and are responsible for
the matters related to such committees.
For the general reasons stated, the Directors
are of the view that the Group is able to operate
independently from En+, notwithstanding the fact
that nine Directors were nominated by En+.
Based on the above, the Board is satisfied that
the Board as a whole, together with our senior
management team, are able to perform their
managerial role in the Group independently.

(d) the Group is currently already a very large
volume user with significant negotiating power in
the Russian power market. In 2014, the Group
has consumed approximately 29% of the power
generated in Siberia; and
(e) the power plants owned or controlled by Mr.
Deripaska are located in remote regions where
there is a limited number of large volume users
located in proximity to such plants. Sales to
distant users would involve significant transmission
losses and, because Siberia is a surplus energy
producer, the result is that these plants are more
reliant on the customer rather than vice versa.

Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its
businesses, and operates as a business group which
is separate from and fully independent of En+.
The Group has, as disclosed under the section
entitled “Connected Transactions” of this Annual
Report, entered into contracts with companies
controlled by Mr. Deripaska for the purchase of
electricity, and may continue to do so in the future.
As aluminium production is energy intensive,
access to relatively inexpensive Siberian
hydropower is central to the competitive strategy
of the Group. However, notwithstanding the
volume of such purchases from companies
owned and controlled by Mr. Deripaska and the
importance of electricity costs to the production
activities of the Group, the Company does not
consider that it is, as a consequence, overly
reliant on Mr. Deripaska for the following
reasons:
(a) the Group has access to alternative sources of
electricity as the Group’s Russian smelters are
connected to the Russian power grid, meaning
that electricity supplies can be obtained from
various power plants, all of which are also
connected to the grid. These supplies are
available to the Group at market prices;
(b) the Group purchases electricity in accordance
with the Rules of the Wholesale Electricity
and Capacity Market at contract prices
in accordance with direct sale-purchase
agreements with suppliers (both related or
unrelated to the Controlling Shareholder) and/
or at market prices for electricity sold on the
market irrelative to the particular supplier. In
2014, the overall share of electricity purchased
by the Group’s aluminium plants from suppliers
related to the Controlling Shareholder
did not exceed 52%.The Group has an
option of switching to suppliers unrelated
to the Controlling Shareholder including
by purchasing electricity on the wholesale
electricity market, though there would be
certain price impact;
(c) none of the contracts is in take-or-pay format;

Financial Independence
The Group’s financial auditing system is
independent from En+ and employs a sufficient
number of dedicated financial accounting personnel
responsible for financial auditing of the Group’s
accounts. The Company has independent bank
accounts and independent tax registration. The
Group’s treasury operations are handled by the
Company’s treasury department, whose functions
include financing, treasury and cash managements
and which operates independently from En+ and
shares no functions or resources with En+. The
Group’s choice of financial institutions is mainly
based on the credit standing of the institutions and the
terms offered by them. As at the year end of 2014,
En+ had not provided any security and/or guarantee
over the Group’s borrowings. As a result of the above
analysis, the Directors believe that the Group is able
to maintain financial independence from En+.
Extent of Competition
The only En+ businesses which compete with or
are likely to compete with the Group’s business,
either directly or indirectly, are those excluded
businesses described below. However, by reason
of the nature of such excluded businesses and the
clear delineation between the Group’s business and
such excluded business, the Group is fully capable
of carrying on its business independently of and at
arm’s length from such excluded business.
There is no real competitive threat to the Group’s
business from the excluded business and there is no
intention of the Company to acquire such excluded
business.
Mr. Deripaska is a beneficial owner of En+, the
substantial shareholder of CEAC.
Mr. Deripaska is a beneficial owner of En+,
the substantial shareholder of the KraMZ group of
companies. Most of the KraMZ plant’s raw materials
(principally aluminium) are purchased from companies
within the Group (primarily KrAZ). KraMZ’s main
customers are industrial customers located within Russia
and abroad that purchase aluminium rods, profiles,
tubes and cast aluminium alloys.
In addition, Mr. Deripaska is a beneficial owner
of En+, the substantial shareholder of DOZAKL, one

B. SUAL Partners
SUAL Partners is a limited liability company
incorporated under the laws of the Bahamas
whose registered office is at 2nd Terrace West,
Centreville, Nassau, Commonwealth of the
Bahamas. SUAL Partners is beneficially owned by
a number of individuals, with Mr. Len Blavatnik
being a shareholder of SUAL Partners as to more
than 30% of the total issued share capital. SUAL
Partners is a holding company that holds interests
in the Company and a separate kitchenware and
houseware business which does not compete with
the Group’s business.

Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its
businesses, and operates as a business group which
is separate from and fully independent of SUAL
Partners.
Financial Independence
The Group’s financial auditing system is
independent from SUAL Partners and employs a
sufficient number of dedicated financial accounting
personnel responsible for financial auditing of the
Group’s accounts. The Company has independent
bank accounts and independent tax registration.
The Group’s treasury operations are handled
by the Company’s treasury department, whose
functions include financing, treasury and cash
management and which operates independently
from SUAL Partners and shares no functions or
resources with SUAL Partners.
The Group’s choice of financial institutions is
mainly based on the credit standing of the institutions
and the terms offered by them.
As at the year end of 2014, SUAL Partners had
not provided any security and/or guarantee over
the Group’s borrowings.
As a result of the above analysis, the Directors
believe that the Group is financially independent
from SUAL Partners.
Extent of Competition
The Board is of the opinion that SUAL Partners is
not a competitor of the Company.

Independence from SUAL Partners
Having considered all relevant factors, including
the following, the Group is satisfied that it can
conduct its business independently of SUAL Partners:
Independence of the Board and the Group’s
Senior Management from the Senior Management
of SUAL Partners
The Directors are of the view that the Group is
able to operate independently from SUAL Partners
because the Group’s day-to-day operations are
managed by four executive Directors who are
independent of and not connected with SUAL
Partners and the senior management team, who
are all independent of and not connected with
SUAL Partners.
Based on the above, the Board is satisfied that
the Board as a whole, together with the senior

management team, are able to perform their
managerial role in the Group independently.

C. Glencore
Amokenga Holdings is a company incorporated
in Bermuda whose registered office is at 22 Victoria
Street, Canon’s Court, Hamilton, HM12, Bermuda.
Amokenga Holdings is ultimately controlled by
Glencore, which is a public company listed on the
London Stock Exchange, with secondary listings
on the Hong Kong and Johannesburg Stock
Exchange’s. No individual shareholder controls
more than 20% of the share capital of Glencore.
Glencore’s industrial and marketing activities are
supported by a global network of more than 90
offices located in over 50 countries and employ
around 200,000 people, including contractors.
Mr. Glasenberg is a shareholder, director and
Chief Executive Officer of Glencore, whose
principal business is the production and trading of
commodities including aluminium. Mr. Glasenberg
is a Non-executive Director of the Company and
is also a member of the Corporate Governance
and Nominations Committee, the Standing
Committee and the Norilsk Nickel Investment
Supervisory Committee. As he is not an executive
Director, he does not participate in the day-to-day

127

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

of Russia’s manufacturers of aluminium composite
tape. It manufactures composite aluminium tape
(Lamister, Alumopolyethylene), anodised sheet and
strip for composite panels, strip for soft food cans
and aluminium strips for lamplight reflectors and lath
ceilings in Russia and the CIS. DOZAKL purchases
most of its raw materials (principally aluminium
coil) from the Group’s foil mills and on market.
DOZAKL’s main customers are industrial customers
located within Russia and the CIS.
KraMZ and DOZAKL are focused on the
downstream market for aluminium products, and not
the upstream market on which the Group has taken
a strategic decision to focus. As a result, a decision
was taken not to include them in the Group at the
time of the 2007 merger that formed the Group
because they do not fit the Group’s strategic profile,
which is to focus on more profitable upstream
businesses. CEAC is a geographically isolated
producer of aluminium and would not be of interest
to the Group due to its relatively high cost structure
and certain privatisation obligations. The Company
does not consider the above operations to pose any
real competitive threat due to their small size, limited
geographical reach and focus on the downstream
segment, which is not part of the Company’s
business strategy.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

management of the Company, and accordingly
is not involved in the daily operations of the
aluminium trading division and so does not
have access to confidential contracts entered
into by that division. Notwithstanding that his
role on the Board as a Non-executive Director
does not require his involvement in the day-today management of the Company, this does
not preclude Mr. Glasenberg from fulfilling his
fiduciary duties. In case Mr. Glasenberg has a
conflicting interest, pursuant to the Articles of
Association of the Company, he shall abstain
from voting at Board meetings when a conflicted
resolution is to be discussed and voted on,
subject to certain exceptions.
When the Group acquired certain alumina
businesses of Glencore in late March 2007,
it became subject to a contract for the supply
of alumina to Glencore that continued through
2008, in declining amounts. The Group sold to
Glencore approximately 41% of its excess alumina
in monetary terms in 2014. The Company also
has long term supply contracts with Glencore for
alumina and primary aluminium, and Glencore
was the Group’s largest customer of alumina and
primary aluminium in the financial year, accounting
for approximately 40% of the Group’s sales of
primary aluminium.
Independence from Glencore
Having considered all relevant factors,
including the following, the Group is satisfied
that it can conduct its business independently of
Glencore:

Independence of the Board and the Group’s
Senior Management from the Senior Management
of Glencore
For the general reasons stated above, the
Directors are of the view that the Group is
able to operate independently from Glencore
notwithstanding that one Director is also a
director of Glencore because the Group’s dayto-day operations are managed by four executive
Directors and the senior management team who are
independent of and not connected with Glencore.
Based on the above, the Board is satisfied that
the Board as a whole, together with the senior
management team, are able to perform their
managerial role in the Group independently.

Financial Independence
The Group’s financial auditing system is
independent from Glencore and employs a sufficient
number of dedicated financial accounting personnel
responsible for financial auditing of the Group’s
accounts. The Company has independent bank
accounts and independent tax registration.
The Group’s treasury operations are handled
by the Company’s treasury department, whose
functions include financing, treasury and cash
management and which operates independently
from Glencore and shares no functions or resources
with Glencore.
The Group’s choice of financial institutions is
mainly based on the credit standing of the institutions
and the terms offered by them.
As at the year end of 2014, Glencore had
not provided any security and/or guarantee over
the Group’s borrowings. As a result of the above
analysis, the Directors believe that the Group is
financially independent from Glencore.
Extent of Competition
Glencore participates in the marketing of both
aluminium and alumina from world markets as well
as from industrial assets in which it has an interest.
Glencore’s subsidiaries own 100% of the Columbia
Falls aluminium smelter (which is currently idle),
100% of the Sherwin Alumina Refinery and has an
economic interest of 46.5%17 in Century Aluminium
Company, a NASDAQ-quoted company whose
assets include: the Ravenswood aluminium smelter
(which is currently idle), the Hawesville aluminium
smelter and the Nordural aluminium smelter and a
49.67% equity interest in the Mt. Holly aluminium
smelter. Glencore, in its business of trading, is also a
customer of the Group.
16 SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDERS’ INTERESTS

are aware, the following interests or short positions

D. LTIP and the Production System Incentive Plan
On 11 May 2011, the Board adopted the LTIP,
in which eligible participants (being employees of
the Group) may be entitled to participate. From
the pool of eligible participants, the Board may, at
its discretion, select employees for participation in
the LTIP. The number of shares to be awarded to a
selected employee is determined by the Company
on the “Award Date” (as it is determined in the LTIP
Rules). Unless otherwise determined by the Board,
at its sole discretion, and with the exception of the
vesting of the CEO’s LTIP Award, the awarded
shares and related income for the particular award
period (“LTIP Award”) that are transferable to a
selected employee vest in that selected employee
in installments (which each comprising 20% of the
total LTIP Award), over a five year period (each a
“Tranche”), provided that:
• the selected employee remains an employee
at all times following the Award Date and on
each of the LTIP Award vesting dates; and
• the first Tranche of each LTIP Award will vest
on the vesting date during the calendar year

immediately following the award period for
which such LTIP Award is awarded.
During 2014, the Board did not approve any
LTIP Award for 2013 and, therefore, no Shares
were granted under the 2013 LTIP Award.
Out of those shares conditionally granted under
the 2010 LTIP Award, the fourth tranche of the Shares
vested in November 2014 comprised 1,343,514
Shares. For the year ended 31 December 2014,
Elian Employee Benefit Trustee Limited, as trustee
of the United Company RUSAL Plc Employee
Benefit Trust and the LTIP (“Trustee”) acquired a
total of 1,750,886 Shares with a nominal value of
USD0.01 per Share. The purchased Shares represent
approximately 0.0115% of the Company’s issued
share capital as at 31 December 2014 and at the
Latest Practicable Date.
In June 2013, the Board decided to approve
the establishment of the PSIP, an employee share
award plan aimed at rewarding the Company’s
employees for achievements in the Production
System implementation.
The PSIP is a one-off share award plan and its
objectives are:
• to increase the employees’ commitment to the
achievement of the Group’s strategic goals in
implementing the Production System;
• to share the Group’s success with the
employees;
• to recognize contributions made by certain
employees in implementing the Production
System;
• to enhance alignment of the interests of the
employees with those of the shareholders.
No new shares of the Company were issued for
the purposes of the Plan. The maximum number of
shares awarded under the PSIP does not exceed
0.05% of the total number of issued shares as at the
date of the Award.
The Company, in accordance with the PSIP rules,
selected employee(s) for participation in the PSIP (the
“Employee”). The Directors of the Company or other
connected persons are not eligible for participation
in the PSIP.
The shares awarded under the PSIP that are
transferable to an Employee will vest on each year
over 3 (three) years.
In July 2014, there were 2,006,218 shares
vested in the participants of the PSIP.
Neither LTIP nor the PSIP constitute a share
option scheme or an arrangement analogous to a
share option scheme for the purpose of Chapter 17
of the Listing Rules.
19 PENSION SCHEMES
Information on the Company’s pension schemes

20 SUFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC FLOAT
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has granted
the Company a waiver from strict compliance
with Rule 8.08(1) (a) of the Listing Rules to
accept a lower public float percentage of the
Company of the higher of: (i) 10% of the Shares,
and (ii) the percentage of public shareholding
that equals HK$6 billion at the Listing Date,
as the minimum percentage of public float of
the Company. From the information publicly
available to the Company and within the
knowledge of the Directors as at the Latest
Practicable Date, the Company has sufficiently
maintained the abovementioned public float.

The consolidated financial statements have
been audited by JSC KPMG as a sole auditor who,
having served for the whole of the financial year,
retire and, being eligible, offer themselves for reappointment as the Company’s sole auditor. A
resolution for the re-appointment of JSC KPMG
as sole auditor of the Company is to be proposed
at the forthcoming annual general meeting of the
Company.
22 AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION
The Articles of Association provide that the
Memorandum and the Articles of Association are
only capable of being amended by the passing of
a special resolution. A special resolution is defined
in the Articles of Association as a resolution of the
Company passed by a majority of not less than
three quarters of members who (being entitled to
do so) vote in person, or by proxy, at a general
meeting of the Company of which not less than
twenty-one clear days’ notice, specifying the
intention to propose the special resolution, has
been given. Provided that, if it is so agreed by
a majority in number of the members having the
right to attend and vote at such meeting upon
the resolution, being a majority together holding
not less than ninety-five per cent. of the total
voting rights of the members who have that right,
a resolution may be proposed and passed as a
special resolution at a meeting at which less than
twenty-one clear days’ notice has been given in
accordance with the Jersey Companies Law.

24 SOCIAL INVESTMENTS AND CHARITY
Contribution to the development of the
company’s habitat is a priority for UC RUSAL. UC
RUSAL is not only one of the leaders in aluminium
production, but also one of the most socially
responsible companies in the regions where it
operates, with rich experience in the development
and realisation of sponsorship and charity projects.
When implementing social investment programmes
RUSAL actively cooperates with governmental, nonprofit and business structures, sharing its business
experience with local communities and supporting
social initiatives valuable to the communities in
which it operates. In 2014, UC RUSAL allocated
more than USD13 million to sponsorship and charity
projects.
25 DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN CONTRACTS
Save as disclosed in section 10 (Connected
Transactions) and section 15 (Directors’ interests in
businesses that may compete with the Company)
above, there has been no contract of significance to
the Group, subsisting during or at the end of 2014
in which a Director is or was materially interested,
either directly or indirectly.

GOVERNANCE REPORT
WE BELIEVE THAT HIGH QUALITY
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ENSURES
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
The Directors are committed to upholding the corporate governance of the Company to
ensure that formal and transparent procedures are in place to protect and maximise the
interests of the shareholders. During 2014, 13 Board meetings were held. The Board
also conducted a quarterly review of the effectiveness on the Company’s internal control
system during 2014, on basis of which a set of activities were implemented during the
year.

2. DIRECTORS’ SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS
The Company has adopted a Code for Securities
Transactions by Directors of the Company. The Code
for Securities Transactions was based on the Model
Code as set out in Appendix 10 to the Listing Rules
but it was made more exacting than the required
standard set out in Appendix 10. It was also based
on the provisions of articles L.451-2-1, L.4652 and L.621-18-2 of the French Monetary and
Financial Code, Chapters II and III of Title II of Book
II of the General Regulation of the AMF and Titles
II and III of Book VI of the General Regulation of
the AMF with respect to insider dealing and market
misconduct. The Code for Securities Transactions
was adopted by the Board on 9 April 2010. Having
made specific enquiry of all Directors, all Directors
confirmed that they had fully complied with the
required standard set out in the Model Code and
the Code for Securities Transactions throughout the
Review Period.
The Company has not been notified of any other
transaction by the Directors in application of the
aforementioned provisions.

CORPORATE

The Company adopts international standards
of corporate governance. The Directors believe
that high quality corporate governance leads to
successful business development and increases the
investment potential of the Company, providing
more security for shareholders, partners and
customers as well as reinforcing the Company’s
internal control systems.
By working with international institutions
such as the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and the International Finance
Corporation, the Company developed and
implemented its corporate governance standards,
based on the principles of transparent and
responsible business operations.
The Company adopted a corporate code
of ethics on 7 February 2005. Based on the
recommendations of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the
International Finance Corporation, the Company
further amended the corporate code of ethics in
July 2007. The corporate code of ethics sets out the
Company’s values and principles for many of its
areas of operations.
The Directors adopted a corporate
governance code which is based on the CG Code
in a Board meeting on 11 November 2010. The
Directors believe that the Company has complied
with the code provisions of the CG Code during
the Review Period, other than as described in
paragraphs 3(b) and 3(i) of this Corporate
Governance Report.
The Directors are committed to upholding the
corporate governance of the Company to ensure
that formal and transparent procedures are in

place to protect and maximise the interests of the
shareholders.
Set out below is a detailed discussion of the
corporate governance practices adopted and
observed by the Company during the Review
Period.

GOVERNANCE REPORT

(c) Board meetings
During 2014, 13 Board meetings were held.
At the Board meeting held on 24 February
2015, the Directors approved, among other things,
the annual results of the Company for the year
ended 31 December 2014. On 10 April 2015
the Board approved updated annual results of the
Company for the year ended 31 December 2014.
The schedule for Board meetings is approved on
an annual basis. The Directors are then also provided
on a timely basis with the relevant documents and
copies of the draft resolutions to be considered at
that particular meeting. All Directors are given an
opportunity to include matters in the agenda for the
Board meeting and have access to the secretary
of the Board to ensure that all Board procedures
and all applicable rules are followed. The Board
also enables the Directors to seek independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense in
appropriate circumstances. The Board secretary is
responsible for keeping minutes of the Board meetings
and the secretary of the Company is responsible for
the safe keeping of minutes and resolutions of the
Board at the registered office of the Company.
(d) Board functions and duties
The Board is collectively responsible for the
management and operations of the Company.
The principal functions and duties conferred on the
Board include:
• responsibility for the approval and monitoring
of the overall development strategies, annual
budgets, business plans and material investment
plans relating to the Company’s business;
• monitoring and evaluating the performance of
the Company in respect of its strategies, budgets
and plans;
• approving and supervising the management;
• giving an account of the Company’s activities to
the parties to whom an account is properly due;
and
• ensuring the maintenance of accounting records
in compliance with the legal obligations of the
Company.
The Board has delegated the day-to-day
operation of the Group to executive Directors and
the executive committee to ensure effectiveness and
appropriateness of functions.
The primary role of the executive committee
is to assist the Chief Executive Officer and senior
management with the day-to-day management of
the Group and to assist the Board in formulating
and implementing the strategy of the Group and
monitoring its performance.

Additional duties and responsibilities of the
executive committee include, but are not limited to,
developing Group strategy for Board approval and
implementing such strategy once approved, reviewing
and opining on any matter involving expenditure
of more than USD75 million before referring such
matter to the Board, and overseeing and monitoring
the financial performance of the Group. In addition,
the executive committee is empowered to establish
committees comprising of its members, as well as
other managers from time to time.
The executive committee meets as frequently as
necessary, but not less than twice per month. The
executive committee operates as the Management
Board of RUSAL Global. The Chief Executive Officer
formally reports the decisions and actions of the
executive committee to the Board at meetings of the
Board.
(e) Board powers to issue shares
The Board has been given authority by the
Company’s shareholders to issue Shares. The
mandate is described on pages 83 and 84 of this
Annual Report.
(f)

Relationships among members of the Board
Please refer to the profiles of Directors and
Senior Management for more information about the
relationships among members of the Board.
(g) Shareholders’ Agreements
The Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company
and the Shareholders’ Agreement between Major
Shareholders were both entered into on 22 January
2010 and are still in force. For brief details of these
shareholders’ agreements, please see Appendix A
and Appendix B.
(h) Shareholder Options
Glencore has granted En+ and SUAL Partners
the Glencore Call Option to acquire all Shares held
by Glencore on the date of exercise of the Glencore
Call Option that were also (i) held by Glencore
on 26 March 2007 or (ii) issued to Glencore by
the Company after 26 March 2007 but before the
exercise of the Glencore Call Option. The Glencore
Call Option may only be exercised by En+ but,
following exercise, SUAL Partners has the right to
participate in proportion to their holding of Shares
at that time vis-à-vis En+. The Glencore Call Option
is exercisable until 26 March 2017.
The exercise price of the option will be
determined by an investment bank as 120% of the
higher of (i) the market value of Glencore’s option
securities, which is determined by reference to the
enterprise value of the Group on the relevant option
exercise date or after an initial public offering, the
volume weighted average price of a Share over
the preceding five trading days; and (ii) a valuation
calculated by reference to the cumulative aggregate

138

independent non-executive Directors (none of whom
had disclosed material interests on any of those
occasions) were present.

(i)

4. CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Board meetings at which Directors have
material interests
A.1.7 of the CG Code states that “If a substantial
shareholder or a director has a conflict of interest
in a matter to be considered by the board
which the board has determined to be material,
the matter should be dealt with by a physical
board meeting rather than a written resolution.
Independent non-executive directors who, and
whose close associates, have no material interest
in the transaction should be present at that board
meeting.”
The Board generally endeavoured throughout
the twelve-month period ended 31 December 2014
to ensure that it did not deal with business by way of
written resolution where a substantial shareholder of
the Company or a Director had disclosed an interest
in a matter to be considered by the Board which
the Board determined to be material. As a result,
there were only two occurrences (out of the twenty
four written resolutions the Board passed during the
period) when urgent business was dealt with by the
Board by way of written resolution where a material
interest of a Director was stated to have been
disclosed. In both of those instances, the interest
of the Director was a potential conflict of interest
by virtue of a board position held by a director
with the entity contracting with the Company. On
both occurrences, the written resolutions were
supplemental to the approval of the matter which
had been approved by previous Board meetings
that had been held rather than an approval of a
new transaction. In each case, the resolution was
passed by the requisite majority excluding any of the
materially interested Directors.
Of the thirteen Board meetings held in the
twelve-month period ended 31 December 2014
where one or more Director(s) had disclosed a
material interest, all the independent non-executive
Directors (who had not disclosed material interests
in the transaction) were present at nine of the Board
meetings held. Four Board meetings were held
where one of the five independent non-executive
Directors was absent from the meeting. Given the
size of the Board and the amount of urgent business
transacted by the Company where Directors
and substantial shareholders of the Company
have material interests, it is difficult to rearrange
any scheduled Board meeting or postpone the
discussion of such business in order to ensure all
of the independent non-executive Directors are
present. The Board meetings on those occasions
were therefore proceeded with despite the fact that
certain independent non-executive Directors were
not able to attend but on each occasion most of the

The roles of the Chairman of the Board and the
Chief Executive Officer are segregated and are
independent to each other. The Chairman (being
Mr. Matthias Warnig) is chiefly responsible for
maintaining the effective operation of the Board.
The Chairman is also responsible for chairing
Board meetings, briefing Board members on issues
discussed at Board meetings and ensuring good
corporate governance practices and procedures
are established. Mr. Oleg Deripaska was the Chief
Executive Officer prior to 17 November 2014
and Mr. Vladislav Soloviev is the Chief Executive
Officer from 17 November 2014 onwards. The role
as Chief Executive Officer is primarily concerned
with the supervision of the execution of the policies
determined by the Board particularly in the
areas of production and supply chain, financial
management and corporate finance, sales
and marketing and others. The Company has
approved a policy statement setting out those
responsibilities to be undertaken by the Chairman
and those to be undertaken by the Chief
Executive Officer. The Chairman is responsible
for leadership of the Board and for creating the
conditions necessary to allow the Board and
individual Directors to operate effectively. The
Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day
to day management of the Group and ensuring
that the strategic decisions made by the Board
are implemented.
5. INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules requires that an
issuer must appoint independent non-executive
directors representing at least one-third of the
board. In this regard, the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange has granted a waiver to the Company
from strict compliance with the requirements
under Rules 3.10A and 3.11 of the Listing Rules.
The percentage of the number of our independent
non-executive Directors (i.e. 27.8%) is very close
to the one-third requirement under Rule 3.10A
of the Listing Rules. The current composition
of the Board represents an appropriate mix of
Directors which offers sufficient independent
checks and balances and an appropriate
governance structure for the Company. As at
the Latest Practicable Date, the Company had 5
out of 18 Directors who are independent nonexecutive Directors, and there is no change
in the shareholders’ agreement in relation to

139

EBITDA of the Group for the preceding 12 quarters
and the discounted enterprise value/EBITDA

board nominations/appointments (as described
on pages 287 and 288 of the Company’s
prospectus dated 31 December 2009).
The Board believes that all independent nonexecutive Directors have appropriate and sufficient
industry or finance experience and qualifications
to carry out their duties so as to protect the interests
of shareholders of the Company. One of the
independent non-executive Directors, Dr. Peter
Nigel Kenny, started his career at PriceWaterhouse
and is a Chartered Accountant.
Each of the independent non-executive Directors
has undertaken to inform the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange and/or the Securities and Futures
Commission as soon as practicable if there is any
subsequent change of circumstances which may
affect their independence. The Company has also
received a written confirmation from each of the
independent non-executive Directors in respect of
their independence. The Board considers that all
independent non-executive Directors are independent
by reference to the factors stated in the Listing Rules.

CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE REPORT

6. NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS AND THE
WORK OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
AND NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Company established a corporate
governance and nomination committee with written
terms of reference in compliance with the CG Code.
The primary functions of the Corporate
Governance and Nomination Committee are,
among other things, to develop, recommend and
annually review corporate governance guidelines,
policies and practices for the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries on corporate governance
and compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements, to oversee corporate governance
matters, to review and monitor the training and
continuous professional development of Directors
and senior management, to develop, review and
monitor the Company’s code of conduct and
compliance manual and applicable to employees
and Directors, reviewing the Company’s compliance
with the CG Code set out in Appendix 14 of
the Listing Rules and disclosure in the Corporate
Governance Report, and to make recommendations
to the Board, including those in relation to the
appointment and removal of Directors. The
Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee
is provided with sufficient resources to discharge
its duties and its terms of reference also permit it to
obtain access to a legal adviser.
In recommending a candidate for appointment
to the Board, the Corporate Governance and
Nomination Committee is required to determine
criteria, objectives and procedures for selecting
Board members, including factors such as
independence (in the case of independent non-

executive directors), diversity, age, future succession
planning, integrity, skills, expertise, experience,
knowledge about the Company’s business and
industry, and willingness to devote adequate time
and effort to Board responsibilities. In identifying
suitable candidates the Corporate Governance
and Nomination Committee is required to use open
advertising or the services of external advisers to
facilitate the search, consider candidates from
a wide range of backgrounds and consider
candidates on merit against objective criteria, taking
care that appointees have enough time to devote to
the position.
The Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee consists of a majority of independent
non-executive Directors. The members are as
follows:
• Mr. Philip Lader (Chairman of the Committee,
Independent Non-executive Director)
• Dr. Peter Nigel Kenny (Independent Nonexecutive Director)
• Mr. Mark Garber (Independent Non-executive
Director)
• Mr. Ivan Glasenberg (Non-executive Director)
• Ms. Ekaterina Nikitina (Non-executive Director)
The Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee has held 5 meetings during the
Review Period. At these meetings, the Corporate
Governance and Nomination Committee
considered, amongst other things, (i) the annual
general meeting materials, (ii) the recommendation
of qualified individuals to the Board, including Mr.
Daniel Lesin Wolfe, (iii) changes in the executive
committee, (iv) changes to the composition of the
Board committees, (v) provisions of the new Hong
Kong Companies Ordinance and amendments to
the Listing Rules.
The members of the Corporate Governance and
Nomination Committee have regularly attended
and actively participated in meetings. For the
attendance record of the meetings held by the
Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee
during 2014, please refer to paragraph 3(a) of this
Corporate Governance Report.
According to the Articles of Association, at every
annual general meeting, one-third of the Directors
or, if their number is not three or a multiple of three,
the number nearest to one-third shall retire from
office; but if any Director has at the start of the annual
general meeting been in office for three years or more
since his last appointment or reappointment, he shall
retire at the annual general meeting. The Directors
to retire by rotation shall be, first, those who wish to
retire and not be re-appointed to office and, second,
those who have been longest in office since their last
appointment or re-appointment. As between persons
who became or were last re-appointed directors
on the same day, those to retire shall (unless they
otherwise agree among themselves) be determined

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors acknowledge that it is their
responsibility to prepare the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 December 2014, in
accordance with applicable law and IFRS, and that
these consolidated financial statements must give a
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group
and of the results and cash flow for that period.
The Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires
the Directors to prepare consolidated financial
statements for each financial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company
and its subsidiaries and of the profit or loss of the
Company and its subsidiaries for that period. In
preparing these consolidated financial statements,
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and apply
them consistently;

• make judgments and estimates which are
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards
have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the
consolidated financial statements; and
• prepare the consolidated financial statements on
the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate
to presume that the Company will continue in
business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and enable them to ensure that the
consolidated financial statements comply with
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The Chief Financial Officer of the Group is
required to regularly present and explain to the
Audit Committee and the Board reports on the
Group’s financial position and operating results, and
report other matters that may have a material impact
upon the financial performance and operations in
order that the Audit Committee and the Board may
make informed decisions.
The consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
reporting responsibility of the external auditors of
the Company on the financial statements of the
Group are set out in the independent auditors’
report on pages 149 and 150 of this Annual
Report.

The Company’s internal control system has
been designed to safeguard the assets of the
Company, maintain proper accounting records,
ensure execution with appropriate authority and
compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
The Board is responsible for maintaining and
reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control system. The Board has overall
responsibility for the establishment and oversight of
the Company’s risk management framework. The
Board has established a risk management group
within the Directorate for control, internal audit and
business coordination (hereinafter referred to as
the Directorate for control), which is responsible
for developing and monitoring the Company’s risk
management policies. The Directorate for control
reports regularly to the Board on its activities.
The Company’s risk management policies are
established to identify and analyse the risks faced
by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and
controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to
limits. Risk management policies and systems are
reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market
conditions and the Company’s activities. The
Company, through its training and management
standards and procedures, aims to develop a
disciplined and constructive control environment
in which all employees understand their roles and
obligations.
The Company’s Audit Committee oversees
how management monitors compliance with
the Company’s risk management policies and
procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk
management framework in relation to the risks faced
by the Company. The Company’s Audit Committee
is assisted in its oversight role by the Company’s
internal audit function, which undertakes both
regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management
controls and procedures, the results of which are
reported to the Audit Committee.
The internal control capability is regularly
improved and enhanced.
The Board has conducted a quarterly review of
the effectiveness on the Company’s internal control
system during 2014. The following activities were
implemented in 2014:
Key steps for the optimisation of procurement
activities in 2014:
√ Control of procurement of materials, equipment,
transportation and construction services selection

and participation in other corporate commissions
and committees

specialists Willis Group and Engineering Center

optimisation of Company insurance programmes
√ Formation of the annual Corporate Risk Map of
the Company and providing quarterly reports
to the Audit Committee on the status of the
Company’s risk management
√ Preparing of UC RUSAL risk insurance
programme in 2014-2015
Audit process is linked to planned activity
which includes risk charts in operational areas
and tasks given by the CEO, Management and
management bodies of the Company. All audits
are aimed at identification of material risks,
assessment of the existing key parameters of the
business processes and issuing recommendations for
improving the internal control system and monitoring
recommendations issued as follow-up to audits.
Pursuant to the Listing Rules and IFRS 24, 28, 31
the Company has developed and implemented a
multi-level system of control over transactions with
related parties, so that the Company can prevent
non-compliance with the Listing Rules and other
applicable regulations.
These measures led to the improvement of risk
identification quality and increased responsibility of
persons involved in risk management process.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, the
Audit Committee conducted regular assessment
of risks and the Group’s internal control system
effectiveness.
For the year ended 31 December 2014, the
Directors consider that the Group’s internal control
system complied with the CG Code.
12. RELEVANT OFFICERS’ SECURITIES
TRANSACTIONS
The Company has also adopted a code for
Securities Transactions by Relevant Officers of the
Company (the “Relevant Officers Code”). The

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent auditor’s report to the members of United Company RUSAL Plc
(Incorporated in Jersey with limited liability)
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of United Company RUSAL
Plc (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the Consolidated and Company
Statements of Financial Position as at 31 December 2014, the Consolidated Statements of Income,
Comprehensive Income, Changes in Equity and Cash Flows for the year then ended, and notes, comprising
a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A
of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report or for the
opinions we have formed.
(A) DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 3, the directors are
responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance
with applicable law, International Financial Reporting Standards and the disclosure requirements of the
Hong Kong Companies Ordinance and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to
enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error. The directors are also responsible for being satisfied that the consolidated financial
statements give a true and fair view.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.
Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material
misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the
entity’s preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of United Company RUSAL Plc - continued
(C) OPINION
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2014 and of the Group’s net profit and its cash flows
for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and have been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and the disclosure
requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.
(D) OTHER MATTER
In our report dated 24 February 2015, we expressed an opinion on the Group’s consolidated financial
statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014 that was qualified for the effect of such
adjustments, if any, that might have been determined to be necessary had we been able to obtain sufficient
appropriate audit evidence in relation to the Group’s estimate of the share of profit, other comprehensive
income and foreign currency translation loss of the Group’s equity investee, OJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel
(“Norilsk Nickel”). Since that date, the directors have obtained the required information and have adjusted
the Group’s accounting for the Norilsk Nickel investment. We have audited the adjustments described in
note 1(d) to the consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate
and have been properly applied. Accordingly, our present report on the Group’s consolidated financial
statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014, as presented herein and approved by the
Board of Directors on 10 April 2015, is different from our previous report dated 24 February 2015.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(E) MATTERS ON WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT BY EXCEPTION
Other than the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion, we have nothing to report in respect
of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to you if, in our
opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company; or
• the financial statements of the Company are not in agreement with the accounting records; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

(a) Organisation
United Company RUSAL Plc (the “Company” or “UC RUSAL”) was established by the controlling
shareholder of RUSAL Limited (“RUSAL”) as a limited liability company under the laws of Jersey on 26
October 2006. On 27 January 2010, the Company successfully completed a dual placing on the Main
Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (“Stock Exchange”) and the Professional Segment of
NYSE Euronext Paris (“Euronext Paris”) (the “Global Offering”) and changed its legal form from a limited
liability company to a public limited company.
The Company’s registered office is 44 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, JE4 9WG.
The Company directly or through its wholly owned subsidiaries controls a number of production and
trading entities (refer to note 35) engaged in the aluminium business and other entities, which together with
the Company are referred to as “the Group”.
Upon successful completion of the Global Offering, the Company issued 1,636,363,646 new shares in

162

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

ore into alumina, the smelting of primary aluminium from alumina and the fabrication of aluminium and aluminium
alloys into semi-fabricated and finished products. The Group sells its products primarily in Europe, Russia, other
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (“CIS”), Asia and North America.

(d) Previously issued Consolidated Financial Statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014
The Group has previously issued consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31
December 2014 dated 24 February 2015. At that date the Group was unable to obtain consolidated
IFRS financial statements of the Group’s significant equity investee, OJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel, as at and
for year ended 31 December 2014. Consequently the Group estimated its share in the profits and other
comprehensive income of OJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel for the year ended 31 December 2014 based on
publicly available information at that time. On 31 March 2015 OJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel published
its IFRS consolidated financial statements and management reassessed its share in the profits and other
comprehensive income of OJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel based on this information. As a result, management
concluded that share of profits of associates and foreign currency translation differences for foreign
operations were overstated by USD384 million and USD692 million, respectively, and share of other
comprehensive income of associates and interests in associates were understated by USD9 million and
USD317 million, respectively, in the Group’s previously issued consolidated financial statements as at and
for the year ended 31 December 2014 dated 24 February 2015.
These consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2014 have been
adjusted accordingly.
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION
(a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), which collective term includes all International Accounting
Standards and related interpretations, promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board
(“IASB”).
These consolidated financial statements also comply with the applicable requirements of the Hong Kong
Companies Ordinance, which for this financial year and the comparative period continue to be those of
the predecessor Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32), in accordance with transitional and saving
arrangements for Part 9 of the new Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622), “Accounts and Audit”,
which are set out in sections 76 to 87 of Schedule 11 to that Ordinance. These financial statements also
comply with the applicable disclosure provisions of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.
The IASB has issued a number of new and revised IFRSs. For the purpose of preparing these consolidated
financial statements, the Group has adopted all these new and revised IFRSs, except for any new standards
or interpretations that are not yet effective as at 31 December 2014. The revised and new accounting
standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the accounting year beginning on 1 January
2014 are set out in note 39.
163

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(c) Business environment in emerging economies
The Russian Federation, Ukraine, Jamaica, Nigeria and Guinea have been experiencing political and
economic changes that have affected, and may continue to affect, the activities of enterprises operating in
these environments. Consequently, operations in these countries involve risks that typically do not exist in
other markets, including reconsideration of privatisation terms in certain countries where the Group operates
following changes in governing political powers.
The recent conflict in Ukraine and related events has increased the perceived risks of doing business
in the Russian Federation. The imposition of economic sanctions on Russian individuals and legal entities
by the European Union, the United States of America, Japan, Canada, Australia and others, as well as
retaliatory sanctions imposed by the Russian government, has resulted in increased economic uncertainty
including more volatile equity markets, a depreciation of the Russian Ruble, a reduction in both local and
foreign direct investment inflows and a significant tightening in the availability of credit. The longer term
effects of recently implemented sanctions, as well as the threat of additional future sanctions, are difficult
to determine.
The consolidated financial statements reflect management’ s assessment of the impact of the
Russian, Ukrainian, Jamaican, Nigerian and Guinean business environments on the operations and
the financial position of the Group. The future business environment may differ from management’ s
assessment.

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

(b) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost basis
except as set out in the significant accounting policy in note 3(c) below.
(c) Functional and presentation currency
The Company’s functional currency is the United States Dollar (“USD”) because it reflects the economic
substance of the underlying events and circumstances of the Company. The functional currencies of the
Group’s significant subsidiaries are the currencies of the primary economic environment and key business
processes of these subsidiaries and include USD, Russian Roubles (“RUB”), Ukrainian Hryvna and Euros
(“EUR”). The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, rounded to the nearest million, except
as otherwise stated herein.
(d) Use of judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements, and the reported revenue and costs during the relevant period.
Management bases its judgements and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that
are believed to be appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRSs that have a significant effect on the
consolidated financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year
are discussed in note 38.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(e) Changes in accounting policies and presentation
The accounting policies and judgements applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements
are the same as those applied by the Group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year
ended 31 December 2013.
3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following significant accounting policies have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in
these consolidated financial statements.
(a) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing
control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable are taken into account. The consolidated
financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that
control commences until the date that control ceases.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of the net assets of subsidiaries attributable to interests that
are not owned by the Company, whether directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, and in respect of which the
Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group
as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial
liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity,
separately from equity attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company. Non-controlling interests in the
results of the Group are presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income and the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the total profit or loss and total comprehensive income
for the year between non-controlling interests and the equity shareholders of the Company.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling
interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
164

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for
as equity transactions, whereby adjustments are made to the amounts of controlling and non-controlling
interests within consolidated equity to reflect the change in relative interests, but no adjustments are made to
goodwill and no gain or loss is recognised.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in that
subsidiary, with a resulting gain or loss being recognised in the statement of income. Any interest retained in
that former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is recognised at fair value and this amount is regarded
as the fair value on initial recognition of a financial asset (refer to note 3(c)) or, when appropriate, the cost
on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or joint venture (refer to note 3(a) (iv)).
In the Company’s statement of financial position, an investment in a subsidiary is stated at cost less
impairment losses.
(ii) Acquisitions of non-controlling interests
The acquisition of an additional non-controlling interest in an existing subsidiary after control has been
obtained is accounted for as an equity transaction with any difference between the cost of the additional
investment and the carrying amount of the net assets acquired at the date of exchange recognised directly in
equity.

(iv) Associates and joint ventures (equity accounted investees)
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control,
over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds
between 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of another entity. Joint ventures are those entities over
whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and which require
unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (equity
accounted investees) and are recognised initially at cost. The Group’s investment also includes goodwill
identified on acquisition. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the income
and expenses and equity movements of equity accounted investees, after adjustments to align the
accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control
commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of
losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest, including
any long-term investments, is reduced to nil, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued (but
disclosed) except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to, or has made payments on behalf of,
the investee.
When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate or joint control over a joint
ventures, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in that investee, with a resulting gain or loss
being recognised in the statement of income. Any interest retained in that former investee at the date when
significant influence or joint control is lost is recognised at fair value and this amount is regarded as the fair
value on initial recognition of a financial asset (refer to note 3(c)), or, when appropriate for joint ventures,
the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate.
When an associate sells equity interests in its subsidiaries to its non-controlling shareholders in an
equity transaction, this represents a dilution of the Group’s indirect interest in the subsidiary of the
associate and therefore gives rise to the recognition of a gain or loss in the Group’s consolidated financial
statements.
(v) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains
arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent
of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains,
but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

(iii) Acquisitions from entities under common control
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the common control
of the shareholder that controls the Company are accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the
beginning of the earliest period presented or, if later, at the date that common control was established. The
assets and liabilities acquired are recognised at the carrying amounts recognised previously in the Group’s
controlling shareholder’s consolidated financial statements. The components of the equity of the acquired
entities are added to the same components within Group equity except that any share capital of the
acquired entities is recognised as part of additional paid-in capital.

(b) Foreign currencies
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the
exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between
the amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest
and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange
rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency are measured based
on historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Foreign currency
differences arising on retranslation are recognised in the statement of income, except for differences
arising on the retranslation of qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent the hedge is effective, which is
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
(ii) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising
on acquisition, are translated from their functional currencies to USD at the exchange rates ruling at the
reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to USD at exchange rates
approximating exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income and presented in the currency translation reserve in equity. For the purposes of foreign currency
translation, the net investment in a foreign operation includes foreign currency intra-group balances for
which settlement is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future and foreign currency differences
arising from such a monetary item are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the
cumulative amount of the currency translation reserve is transferred to the statement of income as part of the
gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a
foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed
to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint
venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant
proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to the statement of income.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(c) Financial instruments
(i) Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in securities, trade and other receivables
(excluding prepayments and tax assets), cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and
other payables (excluding advances received and tax liabilities).
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
A financial instrument is recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of
the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised if the Group’s contractual rights to the cash flows from
the financial assets expire or if the Group transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining
control or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Group’s
obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial
position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle
on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
Held-to-maturity investments
If the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold securities to maturity, then they are classified as
held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method, less any impairment losses (refer to note 3(h) (i)).
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities at initial recognition
of three months or less that are subject to insignificant risk of changes in their fair values, and are used by the
Group in the management of its short-term commitments.
Others
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method, less any impairment losses (refer to note 3(h) (i)). Investments in equity securities that are not quoted

(ii) Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting
The Group enters, from time to time, into various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure
to commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the economic
characteristics and risks of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate
instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative and the
combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.
On initial designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument, the Group formally documents the
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, including the risk management objectives
and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction and the hedged risk, together with the methods that will
be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an assessment, both at
the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments
are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective
hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, and whether the actual results of each hedge are within a
range of 80% - 125%. For a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction should be highly
probable to occur and should present an exposure to variation in cash flows that ultimately could affect
reported profit or loss.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in the
statement of income when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value.
The measurement of fair value of derivative financial instruments, including embedded derivatives, is based
on quoted market prices. Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative
market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Group’s views on
relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit
in such estimates. Changes in the fair value therein are accounted for as described below.
When a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast
transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative
is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any
ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recognised in the statement of income.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is included in the
carrying amount of the asset when the asset is recognised. In other cases, the amount accumulated in equity
is reclassified to the statement of income in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss. If
the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or
exercised, or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the forecast
transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in equity is reclassified to the statement of income.
Changes in the fair value of separated embedded derivatives and derivative financial instruments not
designated for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the statement of income.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment, are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to
IFRSs, was determined by reference to its fair value at that date.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of selfconstructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to
bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the
items and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalised borrowing costs (refer to note 3(n)).
Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that
equipment.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted
for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
The cost of periodic relining of electrolysers is capitalised and depreciated over the expected production
period.
167

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

on a stock exchange and where fair value cannot be estimated on a reasonable basis by other means are
stated at cost less impairment losses (refer to note 3(h) (i)).
Non-derivative financial liabilities
The Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities, subsequent to initial recognition, are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

Gains or losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by
comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and
are recognised net within gain/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment in the statement of
income.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(ii) Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount
of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its
cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs of the day-today servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the statement of income as incurred.
(iii) Exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation activities involve the search for mineral resources, the determination of
technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. Exploration and
evaluation activities include:
• researching and analysing historical exploration data;
• gathering exploration data through topographical, geochemical and geophysical studies;
• exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;
• determining and examining the volume and grade of the resource;
• surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements; and
• conducting market and finance studies.
Administration costs that are not directly attributable to a specific exploration area are charged to the
statement of income.
License costs paid in connection with a right to explore in an existing exploration area are capitalised
and amortised over the term of the permit.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets when it is
expected that expenditure related to an area of interest will be recouped by future exploitation, sale, or,
at the reporting date, the exploration and evaluation activities have not reached a stage that permits a
reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially recoverable ore reserves. Capitalised exploration
and evaluation expenditure is recorded as a component of property, plant and equipment at cost less
impairment losses. As the asset is not available for use, it is not depreciated. All capitalised exploration and
evaluation expenditure is monitored for indications of impairment. Where there are indicators of potential
impairment, an assessment is performed for each area of interest in conjunction with the group of operating
assets (representing a cash-generating unit) to which the exploration is attributed. Exploration areas at which
reserves have been discovered but which require major capital expenditure before production can begin
are continually evaluated to ensure that commercial quantities of reserves exist or to ensure that additional
exploration work is underway or planned. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is not expected to be
recovered it is charged to the statement of income.
Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to mining property, plant and equipment or intangible
assets when development is sanctioned.
(iv) Stripping costs
Expenditure relating to the stripping of overburden layers of ore, including estimated site restoration
costs, is included in the cost of production in the period in which it is incurred.
(v) Mining assets
Mining assets are recorded as construction in progress and transferred to mining property, plant and
equipment when a new mine reaches commercial production.
Mining assets include expenditure incurred for:
• Acquiring mineral and development rights;
• Developing new mining operations.
Mining assets include interest capitalised during the construction period, when financed by borrowings.
(vi) Depreciation
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment (including initial and any subsequent capital
expenditure) are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the estimated useful lives of the specific
assets concerned, or the estimated life of the associated mine or mineral lease, if shorter. Estimates of
residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and any change in estimate is taken into account in
the determination of remaining depreciation charges. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the
lease term and their useful lives. Freehold land is not depreciated.
168

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

The property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line or units of production basis over the
respective estimated useful lives as follows:
• Buildings
30 to 50 years;
• Plant, machinery and equipment
5 to 40 years;
• Electrolysers
4 to 15 years;
• Mining assets
units of production on proven and probable reserves;
• Other (except for exploration
and evaluation assets)
1 to 20 years.
(e) Intangible assets

(ii) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical
knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the statement of income when incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved
products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured
reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are
probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell
the asset. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overhead costs that
are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use and capitalised borrowing costs. Other
development expenditure is recognised in the statement of income when incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses (refer to note 3(h) (ii)).
(iii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at
cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses (refer to note 3(h) (ii)).
(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in
the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated
goodwill and brands, is recognised in the statement of income when incurred.
(v) Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in the statement of income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated
useful lives are as follows:
• software
5 years;
• contracts, acquired in business combinations
2-8 years.
The amortisation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and
adjusted if appropriate.
169

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(i) Goodwill
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, an interest in a joint venture or an associate or an interest in a joint
arrangement that comprises a business, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the
acquired business (or interest in a business) are recognised at their fair values unless the fair values cannot
be measured reliably. Where the fair values of assumed contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably,
no liability is recognised but the contingent liability is disclosed in the same manner as for other contingent
liabilities.
Goodwill arises when the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value of the Group’s interest in the net fair
value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. For
this purpose, goodwill arising on a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units expected
to benefit from the acquisition and any impairment loss recognised is not reversed even where circumstances
indicate a recovery in value.
In respect of associates or joint ventures, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying
amount of the interest in the associate and joint venture and the investment as a whole is tested for
impairment whenever there is objective evidence of impairment. Any impairment loss is allocated to the
carrying amount of the interest in the associate and joint venture.
When the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the cost of
acquisition, the difference is recognised immediately in the statement of income.

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

(f) Leased assets
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal
to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial
recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
The corresponding finance lease obligation is included within interest bearing liabilities. The interest
element is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Assets held under other leases (operating leases) are not recognised in the statement of financial position.
Payments made under the lease are charged to the statement of income in equal instalments over the
accounting periods covered by the lease term, except where an alternative basis is more representative of
the pattern of benefits to be derived from the leased assets. Lease incentives received are recognised in the
statement of income as an integral part of the aggregate net lease payments made. Contingent rentals are
charged to the statement of income in the accounting period in which they are incurred.
(g) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is determined under the weighted average cost method, and includes expenditure
incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing
them to their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress,
cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
The production costs include mining and concentrating costs, smelting, treatment and refining costs, other
cash costs and depreciation and amortisation of operating assets.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(h) Impairment
(i) Financial assets
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to
determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be
impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated
future cash flows of that asset occurred after the initial recognition of that asset and the impact can be
estimated reliably.
Objective evidence that financial assets (including equity securities) are impaired can include default or
delinquency by a debtor, restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not
consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy and the disappearance of an
active market for a security. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a significant or prolonged
decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the
difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted
at the original effective interest rate.
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining
financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in the statement of income.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the
impairment loss was recognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised
in the statement of income.
Impairment losses for trade receivables included within trade and other receivables whose recovery is
considered doubtful but not remote are recorded using an allowance account. When the Group is satisfied
that recovery is remote, the amount considered irrecoverable is written off against trade receivables directly
and any amounts held in the allowance account relating to that receivable are reversed. Subsequent
recoveries of amounts previously charged to the allowance account are reversed against the allowance
account. Other changes in the allowance account and subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written
off directly are recognised in the statement of income.
(ii) Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets,
are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such
indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that are
not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

(i)

Insurance contracts
Where the Group enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other
companies, controlled by the beneficial shareholder of the Group, the Group considers these to be
insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee
contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to
make a payment under the guarantee.
(j) Employee benefits
(i)

Salaries, annual bonuses, paid annual leave and cost of non-monetary benefits
Salaries, annual bonuses, paid annual leave and cost of non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year
in which the associated services are rendered by employees. Where payment or settlement is deferred and
the effect would be material, these amounts are stated at their present values.
(ii) Defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans is
calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned
in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present
value and any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The
discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on government bonds that have maturity dates approximating
the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the net total of any
unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in
future contributions to the plan.
Where there is a change in actuarial assumptions, the resulting actuarial gains and losses are recognised
directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
171

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows
that are largely independent from other asset groups. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of
income. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other
assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair
value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks specific to the asset.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses
recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has
decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates
used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the
asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate or a joint venture is not
recognised separately and, therefore, is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of
the investment is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment
in an associate or a joint venture may be impaired.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an associate or joint venture is calculated as the
difference between its carrying amount after application of the equity method of accounting (refer to
note 3(a) (iv)) and its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of such investment is the greater
of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell. In determining the value in use of the investment
the Group estimates: (a) its share of the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to
be generated by the investee, including the cash flows from the operations of the investee and the
proceeds on the ultimate disposal of the investment; or (b) the present value of the estimated future
cash flows expected to arise from the dividends to be received from the investee and from its ultimate
disposal depending on which available information with respect to each investee is more reliable. An
impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently
increases and the resulting carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have
been determined, after application of the equity method, had no impairment loss previously been
recognised.

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service
by employees is recognised in the statement of income on a straight-line basis over the average period
until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised
immediately.
(iii) State pension fund
The Group makes contributions for the benefit of employees to Russia’s and the Ukrainian State’s pension
funds. The contributions are expensed as incurred.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan
when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss on curtailment comprises any resulting
change in the fair value of plan assets, any change in the present value of the defined benefit
obligation, any related actuarial gains and losses and past service costs that had not previously been
recognised.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(k) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at
a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance costs.
(i) Site restoration
The mining, refining and smelting activities of the Group can give rise to obligations for site restoration
and rehabilitation. Restoration and rehabilitation works can include facility decommissioning and
dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, land rehabilitation, and site restoration. The extent of
work required and the associated costs are dependent on the requirements of law and the interpretations of
the relevant authorities.
Provisions for the cost of each restoration and rehabilitation program are recognised at the time that
environmental disturbance occurs. When the extent of disturbance increases over the life of an operation,
the provision is increased accordingly. Costs included in the provision encompass obligated and reasonably
estimable restoration and rehabilitation activities expected to occur progressively over the life of the
operation and at the time of closure in connection with disturbances at the reporting date. Routine operating
costs that may impact the ultimate restoration and rehabilitation activities, such as waste material handling
conducted as an integral part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. Costs
arising from unforeseen circumstances, such as the contamination caused by unplanned discharges, are
recognised as an expense and liability when the event gives rise to an obligation which is probable and
capable of reliable estimation.
Restoration and rehabilitation provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows,
discounted to their present value and determined according to the probability of alternative estimates of cash
flows occurring for each operation. Discount rates used are specific to the country in which the operation
is located. Significant judgements and estimates are involved in forming expectations of future activities
and the amount and timing of the associated cash flows. Those expectations are formed based on existing
environmental and regulatory requirements.
When provisions for restoration and rehabilitation are initially recognised, the corresponding cost
is capitalised as an asset, representing part of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the
operation. The capitalised cost of restoration and rehabilitation activities is amortised over the estimated
economic life of the operation on a units of production or straight-line basis. The value of the provision is
progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds, creating an expense recognised as
part of finance expenses.
Restoration and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. Those adjustments
are accounted for as a change in the corresponding capitalised cost, except where a reduction in the
provision is greater than the unamortised capitalised cost, in which case the capitalised cost is reduced to nil
and the remaining adjustment is recognised in the statement of income. Changes to the capitalised cost result
in an adjustment to future amortisation charges. Adjustments to the estimated amount and timing of future
restoration and rehabilitation cash flows are a normal occurrence in light of the significant judgements and
estimates involved. Factors influencing those changes include revisions to estimated reserves, resources and
lives of operations; developments in technology; regulatory requirements and environmental management
strategies; changes in the estimated costs of anticipated activities, including the effects of inflation and
movements in foreign exchange rates; and movements in general interest rates affecting the discount rate
applied.

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

(ii) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal
restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future
operating costs are not provided for.
(l) Revenue
Goods sold
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have
been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible
return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the good
and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. This is generally when title passes. If it is probable that
discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a
reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.
For the majority of sales transactions agreements specify that title passes on the bill of lading date, which
is the date the commodity is delivered to the shipping agent.
Revenue is not reduced for royalties or other taxes payable from production.
(m) Other expenses
Social expenditure
To the extent that the Group’s contributions to social programms benefit the community at large and are
not restricted to the Group’s employees, they are recognised in the statement of income as incurred.

(o) Income tax expense
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the
statement of income and other comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised
directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax
is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial
recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they
probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future. New information may become available that causes
the Company to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liability. Such changes to
tax liabilities will impact tax expenses in the period that such a determination is made. Deferred tax is
measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse,
based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority
and the Group has both the right and the intention to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net or
simultaneous basis.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each
reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be
realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as
the liability to pay the related dividends is recognised.

(n) Finance income and expenses
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, changes in the fair value of financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss and foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues,
using the effective interest method.
Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions,
foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
All borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of income using the effective interest method, except

recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the measurement of the assets (and all assets and liabilities
in a disposal group) is brought up-to-date in accordance with applicable IFRSs. Then, on initial classification
as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and
fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then
to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial
assets, deferred tax assets and employee benefit assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with
the Group’s accounting policies.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of
business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the
criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. A disposal group that has been abandoned may
also qualify.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(q) Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may
earn revenue and incur expenses, including revenue and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the
Group’s other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s
CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for
which discrete consolidated financial statements are available.
Individually material operating segments are not aggregated for financial reporting purposes unless
the segments have similar economic characteristics and are similar in respect of the nature of products
and services, the nature of production processes, the type or class of customers, the methods used to
distribute the products or provide the services and the nature of the regulatory environment. Operating
segments which are not individually material may be aggregated if they share a majority of these
criteria.
(r) Related parties
(a) A person, or a close member of that person’s family, is related to the Group if that person:
(i) has control or joint control over the Group;
(ii) has significant influence over the Group; or
(iii) is a member of the key management personnel of the Group or the Group’s parent.
(b) An entity is related to the Group if any of the following conditions applies:
(i) The entity and the Group are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary
and fellow subsidiary is related to the others).
(ii) One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a
member of a group of which the other entity is a member).
(iii) Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party.
(iv) One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity.
(v) The entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the Group or an
entity related to the Group.
(vi) The entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a).
(vii) A person identified in (a) (i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key
management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity).
Close members of the family of a person are those family members who may be expected to influence,
or be influenced by, that person in their dealings with the entity.
4 SEGMENT REPORTING
(a) Reportable segments
The Group has four reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group’s strategic business
units. These business units are managed separately and the results of their operations are reviewed by the
CEO on a regular basis.
Aluminium. The Aluminium segment is involved in the production and sale of primary aluminium and
related products.
Alumina. The Alumina segment is involved in the mining and refining of bauxite into alumina and the sale
of alumina.
174

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

(b) Segment results, assets and liabilities
For the purposes of assessing segment performance and allocating resources between segments,
the Group’s senior executive management monitor the results, assets and liabilities attributable to each
reportable segment on the following bases:
Segment assets include all tangible, intangible assets and current assets with the exception of income
tax assets and corporate assets. Segment liabilities include trade and other payables attributable to the
production and sales activities of the individual segments. Loans and borrowings are not allocated to
individual segments as they are centrally managed by the head office.
Revenue and expenses are allocated to the reportable segments with reference to sales generated by
those segments and the expenses incurred by those segments or which otherwise arise from the depreciation
or amortisation of assets attributable to those segments excluding impairment.
The measure used for reporting segment results is the statement of income before income tax adjusted
for items not specifically attributed to individual segments, such as finance income, costs of loans and
borrowings and other head office or corporate administration costs. The segment profit or loss is included
in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s CEO. Segment profit or loss is used to
measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the
results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.
In addition to receiving segment information concerning segment results, management is provided with
segment information concerning revenue (including inter-segment revenue), the carrying value of investments
and share of profits/(losses) of associates and joint ventures, depreciation, amortisation, impairment and
additions of non-current segment assets used by the segments in their operations. Inter-segment pricing is
determined on a consistent basis using market benchmarks.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill.
The Group’s customer base includes only one customer with whom transactions have exceeded 10%
of the Group’s revenues. In 2014 revenues from sales of primary aluminium and alloys to this customer
amounted to USD2,745 million (2013: USD3,227 million). Details of concentrations of credit risk arising
from this customer are set out in note 31(e).

175

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Energy. The Energy segment includes the Group companies and projects engaged in the mining and
sale of coal and the generation and transmission of electricity produced from various sources. Where
the generating facility is solely a part of an alumina or aluminium production facility it is included in the
respective reportable segment.
Mining and Metals. The Mining and Metals segment includes the equity investment in OJSC MMC
Norilsk Nickel (“Norilsk Nickel”).
Other operations include manufacturing of semi-finished products from primary aluminium for the
transportation, packaging, building and construction, consumer goods and technology industries; and
the activities of the Group’s administrative centres. None of these segments meet any of the quantitative
thresholds for determining reportable segments in 2014 and 2013.
The Aluminium and Alumina segments are vertically integrated whereby the Alumina segment supplies
alumina to the Aluminium segment for further refining and smelting with limited sales of alumina outside the
Group. Integration between the Aluminium, Alumina and Energy segments also includes shared servicing
and distribution.

(iii) Geographic information
The Group’s operating segments are managed on a worldwide basis, but operate in four principal
geographical areas: the CIS, Europe, Africa and the Americas. In the CIS, production facilities operate
in Russia and Ukraine. In Europe, production facilities are located in Italy, Ireland and Sweden. African
production facilities are represented by bauxite mines and an alumina refinery in Guinea and an aluminium
plant in Nigeria. In the Americas the Group operates two production facilities in Jamaica, one in Guyana
and a trading subsidiary in the United States of America.
The following table sets out information about the geographical location of (i) the Group’s revenue from
external customers and (ii) the Group’s property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and interests in
associates and joint ventures (“specified non-current assets”). The geographical location of customers is
based on the location at which the services were provided or the goods were delivered. The geographical
location of the specified non-current assets is based on the physical location of the asset. Unallocated
specified non-current assets comprise mainly goodwill and interests in associates and joint ventures.

Depreciation expense of USD421 million (2013: USD478 million) has been charged to cost of goods
sold, USD6 million (2013: USD8 million) to distribution expenses and USD18 million (2013:
USD19 million) to administrative expenses.
During the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013, no interest cost was capitalised due to
postponement of construction projects as a result of the economic environment.
Included into construction in progress at 31 December 2014 and 2013 are advances to suppliers of
property, plant and equipment of USD20 million and USD23 million, respectively.
(a) Impairment
Management reviewed the carrying amount of the group’s non-financial assets at the reporting date to
determine whether there were any indicators of impairment. Management identified several factors including
declining aluminium prices and plant closures in the industry that indicated that a number of the Group’s
cash-generating units may be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit was
determined by discounting expected future net cash flows of the cash generating unit.
Based on results of impairment testing for the year 2014, management has concluded that no impairment
loss relating to property, plant and equipment should be recognised in these financial statements.
The recoverable amount of a number of the cash generating units tested for impairment are particularly
sensitive to changes in forecast aluminium prices, foreign exchange rates and applicable discount rates.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

Based on results of impairment testing for the year 2013, management has concluded that an impairment
loss relating to property, plant and equipment should be recognised in these financial statements in respect
of the Taishet, Kubikenborg Aluminium and Kremniy cash generating units in the amounts of USD680
million, USD125 million and USD57 million, respectively.
The pre-tax discount rates applied to the Taishet, Kubikenborg Aluminium and Kremniy cash generating
units were 18.61%, 12.20% and 13.60%, respectively, estimated in nominal terms based on an industry
weighted average cost of capital.
The recoverable amount of a number of the cash generating units tested for impairment are particularly
sensitive to changes in forecast aluminium prices, foreign exchange rates, applicable discount rates and
in respect to Taishet, the expected timing of completion of the project and period required to reach full
production capacity.
Additionally, management identified specific items of property, plant and equipment that are no longer in
use and therefore are not considered to be recoverable amounting to USD96 million at 31 December 2014
(2013: USD360 million (including USD115 million of impairment relating specifically to 2013 SUAL plant
closures and USD32 million relating to closure of other Group’s plants)). These assets have been impaired in
full. No further impairment of property, plant and equipment or reversal of previously recorded impairment
was identified by management.
(b) Security
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment subject to lien under loan and swap agreements
was USD600 million as at 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: USD288 million under loan
agreements), refer to notes 26 and 29.

Amortisation and impairment losses

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

(a) Amortisation charge
The amortisation charge is included in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of income.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(b) Goodwill
Goodwill recognised in these consolidated financial statements initially arose on the formation of the
Group in 2000 and the acquisition of a 25% additional interest in the Group by its controlling shareholder
in 2003. The amount of goodwill was principally increased in 2007 as a result of the acquisition of certain
businesses of SUAL Partners and Glencore.
(c) Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets
For the purposes of impairment testing, the entire amount of goodwill is allocated to the aluminium
segment of the Group’s operations. The aluminium segment represents the lowest level within the Group
at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount represents
value in use as determined by discounting the future cash flows generated from the continuing use of the
plants within the Group’s aluminium segment.
At 31 December 2014, management analysed changes in the economic environment and developments
in the aluminium industry and the Group’s operations since 31 December 2013 and performed an
impairment test for goodwill at 31 December 2014 using the following assumptions to determine the
recoverable amount of the segment:
• Total production was estimated based on average sustainable production levels of 3.6 million metric
tonnes of primary aluminium, of 7.4 million metric tonnes of alumina and of 12.4 million metric tonnes of
bauxite. Bauxite and alumina will be used primarily internally for production of primary aluminium;
• Sales prices were based on the long-term aluminium price outlook derived from available industry and
market sources at USD2,010 per tonne for primary aluminium in 2015, USD2,127 in 2016, USD2,203
in 2017, USD2,270 in 2018, USD2,313 in 2019. Operating costs were projected based on the
historical performance adjusted for inflation;
• Nominal foreign currency exchange rates applied to convert operating costs of the Group denominated
in RUB into USD were RUB59.6 for one USD in 2015, RUB55.6 in 2016, RUB53.2 in 2017, RUB51.2
in 2018, RUB49.3 in 2019. Inflation of 4.9% – 11.8% in RUB and 1.5% - 2.5% in USD was assumed in
determining recoverable amounts;
• The pre-tax discount rate was estimated in nominal terms based on the weighted average cost of capital
basis and was 16.2%;
• A terminal value was derived following the forecast period assuming a 2.1% annual growth rate.
Values assigned to key assumptions and estimates used to measure the units’ recoverable amount was
based on external sources of information and historic data. Management believes that the values assigned
to the key assumptions and estimates represented the most realistic assessment of future trends. The results
were particularly sensitive to the following key assumptions:
• A 5% reduction in the projected aluminium price level would have resulted in a decrease in the
recoverable amount by 17% and would not lead to an impairment;
• A 5% increase in the projected level of electricity and alumina costs in the aluminium production would
have resulted in a 5% decrease in the recoverable amount and would not lead to an impairment;
• A 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a 6% decrease in the recoverable amount and
would not lead to an impairment.
Based on results of impairment testing, management concluded that no impairment should be recorded in
the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2014.
At 31 December 2013, management analysed changes in the economic environment and developments
in the aluminium industry and the Group’s operations since 31 December 2012 and performed an
impairment test for goodwill at 31 December 2013 using the following assumptions to determine the
recoverable amount of the segment:
• Total production was estimated based on average sustainable production levels of 3.7 million metric
tonnes of primary aluminium, of 7.4 million metric tonnes of alumina and of 11.6 million metric tonnes of
bauxite. Bauxite and alumina will be used primarily internally for production of primary aluminium;
• Sales prices were based on the long-term aluminium price outlook derived from available industry and
market sources at USD1,865 per tonne for primary aluminium in 2014, USD2,016 in 2015, USD2,107
in 2016, USD2,171 in 2017, USD2,246 in 2018. Operating costs were projected based on the
historical performance adjusted for inflation;
• Nominal foreign currency exchange rates applied to convert operating costs of the Group denominated
in RUB into USD were RUB33.4 for one USD in 2014, RUB34.3 in 2015, RUB34.9 in 2016, RUB36.6
in 2017, RUB36.7 in 2018. Inflation of 4.1% – 5.6% in RUB and 2.2% - 2.5% in USD was assumed in
determining recoverable amounts;
196

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

• The pre-tax discount rate was estimated in nominal terms based on the weighted average cost of capital
basis and was 12%;
• A terminal value was derived following the forecast period assuming a 2.5% annual growth rate.
Values assigned to key assumptions and estimates used to measure the units’ recoverable amount was
consistent with external sources of information and historic data for each cash-generating unit. Management
believes that the values assigned to the key assumptions and estimates represented the most realistic
assessment of future trends. The results were particularly sensitive to the following key assumptions:
• A 5% reduction in the projected aluminium price level would have resulted in full impairment of goodwill
of USD3,397 million;
• A 5% increase in the projected level of electricity and alumina costs in the aluminium production would
have resulted in a 31% decrease in the recoverable amount and would lead to an additional impairment
of USD1,058 million;
• A 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a 32% decrease in the recoverable amount
and would lead to an additional impairment of USD1,080 million.
Based on results of impairment testing, management concluded that an impairment of USD382 million
should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2013.
17 NON-CURRENT ASSETS CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE
On 24 April 2013 the Group completed disposal of 3,873,537 shares in Norilsk Nickel for USD620

The recoverable amount of the investment at 31 December 2014 was determined based on the
underlying value in use based on the following significant assumptions.
• The long term commodity price forecasts for nickel, copper and other by-products, are management’s
estimates based on their experience of the specific commodities markets as at the date of the impairment
test, and are within the range of external market forecasts. The prices used were as follows:

• Total production volume was based on existing production levels for 2013 adjusted for a growth rate of

• Nominal foreign currency exchange rates applied to convert operating costs of the Group denominated
in RUB into USD were RUB59.6 for one USD in 2015, RUB55.6 in 2016, RUB53.2 in 2017, RUB51.2
in 2018, RUB49.3 in 2019. Inflation of 4.9% – 11.8% in RUB and 1.5% - 2.5% in USD was assumed in
determining recoverable amounts.
The pre-tax discount rate was estimated in nominal terms based on the weighted average cost of capital
and was 16.7%.
Management concluded that no impairment is required to be recognised as a result of impairment
testing. Values assigned to key assumptions and estimates used to measure the units’ recoverable amounts
were consistent with external sources of information and historic data. Management believes that the values
assigned to the key assumptions and estimates represented the most realistic assessment of future trends. The
results are not particularly sensitive and would not be impacted by a 5% reduction in projected sales price
level or a 1% increase in discount rate.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Income tax expense or income

BEMO project
For the purposes of impairment testing, the BEMO project was separated into two cash generating units
– the Boguchansky Aluminium Smelter (“BoAZ’) and the Boguchansky Hydro Power Plant (“BOGES”).
The recoverable amount was determined by discounting the expected future net cash flows of each cash
generating unit.
At 31 December 2014, management analysed changes in the economic environment and developments
in the aluminium and power generation industries since 31 December 2013 and performed an impairment
test for its investment in BEMO project at 31 December 2014.
The pre-tax discount rates applied to discount the cash flows for BoAZ and BOGES were 17.2% and
21.5%, respectively, estimated in nominal terms based on an industry weighted average cost of capital.
The recoverable amounts of the two cash generating units are particularly sensitive to changes in forecast
aluminium and electricity prices, foreign exchange rates, applicable discount rates and, in respect to
BoAZ, the expected timing of commencement of the project and the forecast period to reach full production
capacity.
As a result of impairment testing, no further impairment of investment in BEMO project or reversal of
previously recorded impairment was identified by management.
At 31 December 2014, losses of USD375 million related to impairment charges at BoAZ have not been
recognised because the Group’s investment has already been fully written down to nil.
The Group’s share of losses in joint ventures for the year ended 31 December 2013 includes impairment
losses relating to property, plant and equipment of the BEMO project of which USD600 million was
recognised by the Group.
The pre-tax discount rates applied to discount the cash flows for BoAZ and BOGES were 15.5% and
18%, respectively, estimated in nominal terms based on an industry weighted average cost of capital.
The recoverable amount of the two cash generating units are particularly sensitive to changes in forecast
aluminium and electricity prices, foreign exchange rates, applicable discount rates and, in respect to
BoAZ, the expected timing of commencement of the project and the forecast period to reach full production
capacity.
The Group recognised its share of impairment losses in BEMO project entities to the extent of its
investment in the corresponding entity and made the necessary adjustments to the carrying values of each
investment. The Group’s share of losses of related to BoGES and BoAZ were recognized in amount of
USD352 million and USD248 million respectively. The loss relating to BoAZ was recognised to the extent
of Group’s investment. At 31 December 2013, additional losses of USD309 million related to impairment
charges have not been recognised because the Group’s investment has been fully written down to nil.

Retained earnings of the Group’s subsidiaries where dividend distributions are subject to taxation
included USD1,249 million and USD2,127 million as at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013,
respectively, for which deferred taxation has not been provided because remittance of the earnings has
been indefinitely postponed through reinvestment and, as a result, such amounts are considered to be
permanently invested. It was not practicable to determine the amount of temporary differences relating to
investments in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of reversal of the difference. Reversal
is not expected in the foreseeable future. For other subsidiaries in the Group, including the significant trading
companies, the distribution of dividends does not give rise to taxes.

Trade receivables are on average due within 60 days from the date of billing. The receivables that are
neither past due nor impaired (i.e. current) relate to a wide range of customers for whom there was no recent
history of default.
Receivables that were past due but not impaired relate to a number of customers that have a good track
record with the Group. Based on past experience, management believes that no impairment allowance is
necessary in respect of these balances as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the
balances are still considered fully recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
Further details of the Group’s credit policy are set out in note 31(e).
(b) Impairment of trade receivables
Impairment losses in respect of trade receivables are recorded using an allowance account unless the
Group is satisfied that recovery of the amount is remote, in which case the impairment loss is written off
against trade receivables directly.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts during the year, including both specific and collective
loss components, is as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On 3 March and 18 April 2011, one of the Group’s subsidiaries issued two tranches of rouble
denominated bonds, each including 15 million bonds, with a par value of 1,000 roubles each on MICEX.
Maturity of the first tranche is seven years subject to a put option exercisable in March 2014. Maturity of the
second tranche is ten years subject to a put option exercisable in April 2015.
Simultaneously, the Group entered into cross-currency swaps with an unrelated financial institution in
relation to each tranche whereby the first tranche with semi-annual coupon payments of 8.3% p.a. was
transformed into a USD obligation with a matching maturity of USD530 million bearing interest at 5.13%
p. a. and the second tranche with semi-annual coupon payments of 8.5% p.a. was transformed into a USD
obligation with a matching maturity of USD533 million bearing interest at 5.09% p. a. The proceeds of the
bond issues were used for repayment of part of the Group’s outstanding debts.
On 25 February 2014 RUSAL Bratsk entered into a bond sale agreement for the purpose of selling up to
5,000,000 (five million) series 07 bonds which were expected to be bought back under a put-option on 3
March 2014. The selling price under the terms of bonds sale agreement was RUB998.356, or 99.8356%
of the par value of each bond. Simultaneously United Company RUSAL Aluminium Limited entered into a
put-option transaction which may be exercised for up to 5,000,000 (five million) series 07 bonds at a strike
price which will be a function of the announced coupon rate, purchase price, tenor and the expected yield
of the transaction, and is exercisable on 22 February 2016.
On 26 February 2014 cross-currency swap in relation to the first tranche expired.
On 28 February 2014 RUSAL Bratsk announced a coupon rate in respect to the series 07 bond issue of
12% per annum for the 7-10 semi-annual coupon periods.
On 3 March 2014 RUSAL Bratsk successfully performed its obligations under the terms of bondholders
put-option. As result of the put-option being exercised RUB10,947,149 series 07 bonds (about 73% of the
issue) were purchased back by the issuer.
As of 31 December 2014 6,462,455 series 07 bonds and 8,120,893 series 08 bonds were
outstanding (traded in the market).The closing market price at 31 December 2014 was RUB963.4 and
RUB964 per bond for the first and second tranches, respectively.

(a) Pension liabilities
Group subsidiaries in the Russian Federation
The Group voluntarily provides long-term and post-employment benefits to its former and existing
employees including death-in-service, jubilee, lump sum upon retirement, material support for pensioners
and death-in-pension benefits. Furthermore, the Group provides regular social support payments to some of
its veterans of World War II.
The above employee benefit programms are of a defined benefit nature. The Group finances these
programms on a pay-as-you-go basis, so plan assets are equal to zero.
Group subsidiaries in Ukraine
Due to legal requirements, the Ukrainian subsidiaries are responsible for partial financing of the state
hardship pensions for those of its employees who worked, or still work, under severe and hazardous labour
conditions (hardship early retirement pensions). These pensions are paid until the recipient reaches the age
of entitlement to the State old age pension (55-60 years for female (dependent on year of birth) and 60

benefits to its employees including death-in-service, lump sum benefits upon retirement and death-in-pension
benefits.
The above employee benefit programms are of a defined benefit nature. The Group finances these
programms on a pay-as-you-go basis, so plan assets are equal to zero.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Group subsidiaries outside the Russian Federation and Ukraine
At its Guinean and Nigerian entities the Group provides a death-in-service benefit and lump-sum benefits
upon disability and old-age retirement.
At its Guyana subsidiary, the Group provides a death-in-service benefit.
At its Italian subsidiary (Eurallumina) the Group only provides lump sum benefits upon retirement, which
relate to service up to 1 January 2007.
In Ireland (Aughinish Alumina) the Group’s final pay pension plan was wound up with effective date of 2
October 2013. After this date a liability of almost USD2 million remained, which was settled during 2014.
In future the Group’s pension plan will be of a Defined Contribution nature.
In Sweden (Kubikenborg Aluminium AB), the Group provides defined benefit lifelong and temporary
pension benefits. The lifelong benefits are dependent on the past service and average salary level of the
employee, with an accrual rate that depends on the salary bracket the employee is in. The liability relates
only to benefits accrued before 1 January 2004.
All pension plans of the Group are unfunded.
The number of employees eligible for the plans as at 31 December 2014 and 2013 was 56,750 and
59,737, respectively. The number of pensioners as at 31 December 2014 and 2013 was 48,414 and

The Group provides for site restoration obligations when there is a specific legal or constructive obligation
for mine reclamation, landfill closure (primarily comprising red mud basin disposal sites) or specific lease
restoration requirements. The Group does not record any obligations with respect to decommissioning of

a specific plan to discontinue operations at a facility. This is because any significant costs in connection

Actuarial valuation of pension liabilities
The actuarial valuation of the Group and the portion of the Group funds specifically designated for the
Group’s employees were completed by a qualified actuary, Robert van Leeuwen AAG, as at 31 December
2014, using the projected unit credit method as stipulated by IAS 19.
The key actuarial assumptions (weighted average, weighted by DBO) are as follows:

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

areas would be incurred no earlier than when the facility is closed and the facilities are currently expected
to operate over a term in excess of 50-100 years due to the perpetual nature of the refineries and smelters
and continuous maintenance and upgrade programms resulting in the fair values of any such liabilities being
negligible.
The site restoration provision recorded in these consolidated financial statements relates primarily to mine
reclamation and red mud basin disposal sites at alumina refineries and is estimated by discounting the riskadjusted expected expenditure to its present value based on the following key assumptions:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At each reporting date the Directors have assessed the provisions for site restoration and environmental
matters and concluded that the provisions and disclosures are adequate.
(c) Provisions for legal claims
The Group’s subsidiaries are subject to a variety of lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of its
business. As at 31 December 2014, there were several claims filed against the Group’s subsidiaries
contesting breaches of contract terms and non-payment of existing obligations. Management has reviewed
the circumstances and estimated that the amount of probable outflow related to these claims should not
exceed USD15 million (31 December 2013: USD12 million). The amount of claims, where management
assesses outflow as possible approximates USD111 million (31 December 2013: USD175 million).
At each reporting date the Directors have assessed the provisions for litigation and claims and concluded
that the provisions and disclosures are adequate.
(d) Tax provisions
At each reporting date the Directors have assessed the provisions for taxation and concluded that the
provisions and disclosures are adequate.
(e) Provision for guarantees
In September 2013 the Group entered into an agreement with OJSC RusHydro to provide funds to
BoAZ, if the latter is unable to fulfil its obligations under its credit facility with GK Vnesheconombank.
This agreement represents a surety for the increased credit limit obtained for the financing of BoAZ. The
aggregate exposure under the agreement is limited to RUB16.8 billion (USD296 million) and is split
between the Group and OJSC RusHydro in equal proportion.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

During the year 2014 there have been no changes in valuation techniques used to calculate the
derivative financial instruments compared to prior year.
Management believes that the values assigned to the key assumptions and estimates represented the
most realistic assessment of future trends. The results for cross-currency swaps and cross-currency option
on loan are particularly sensitive to changes in RUB/USD exhange rate forward curve. A 22% increase in
RUB/USD exchange rate would result in USD139 million of additional loss. The results for other derivative
instruments are not particularly sensitive to any factors.
Cross-currency option
On 16 December 2013 the Group entered into a new credit facility up to RUB15 billion with VTB Capital Plc
with a maturity of 5 years and an interest rate of 3M Mosprime + 4.0% and drew down RUB10.1 billion (USD309
million) on 17 December 2013. The credit facility includes an option which may be exercised by the bank two
years from the date of entering into the credit facility to convert the credit facility to USD with a 3M LIBOR + 5.05%
interest rate. On 31 December 2014 the Group’s exposure under this option was USD166 million.
Cross-currency swaps
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group entered into cross-currency swaps to transform
the two tranches of its rouble bonds into USD obligations of USD530 million and USD533 million
respectively (refer to note 27). The terms of the swaps were 3 and 4 years, respectively. In February 2012
– August 2013 the Group entered into cross-currency swaps to convert RUB18.3 billion of 5 year rouble
denominated credit facility into a USD denominated liability of USD598 million.
At 31 December 2014 the Group recognised a loss on part of the instruments as they were considered
ineffective. The reasons for this were partial buy-back of bonds in relation to the second tranche, and
change of maturity date for RUB18.3 facility as a result of refinancing.
The secured cross-currency swaps are secured by pledges of 11% shares in OJSC SUAL, 25.1% shares
in Khakas Aluminium Smelter, 25% + 1 share in RUSAL Sayanogorsk, 15% shares in RUSAL Krasnoyarsk
and USD246 million of the Group’s property, plant and equipment.
Petroleum coke supply contracts and other raw materials
In May 2014, the Group entered into long-term petroleum coke supply contract where the price of coke is
determined with reference to the LME aluminium price and average monthly aluminium quotations, namely of
Aluminum MW US Transaction premium, MB Aluminium Premium Rotterdam Low - High» and Aluminum CIF Japan
premium. The strike price for aluminium is set at USD1,809.65 per tonne while the strike aluminium quotations for US,
Europe and Japan are set at USD403.956 per tonne, USD313.3 per tonne and USD366.0 per tonne, respectively.
In May and September 2011, the Group entered into long-term petroleum coke supply contracts where
the price of coke is determined with reference to the LME aluminium price and the Brent oil price. The strike
price for aluminium is set at USD2,403.45 per tonne and USD2,497.72 per tonne, respectively, while the
strike price for oil is set at USD61.10 per barrel and USD111.89 per barrel, respectively.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR VALUES
(a) Fair values
Management believes that the fair values of short-term financial assets and liabilities approximate their
carrying amounts.
The methods used to estimate the fair values of the financial instruments are as follows:
Trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, current loans and borrowings and trade and
other payables: the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity period of the
instruments.
Long-term loans and borrowings, other non-current liabilities: the fair values of other non-current
liabilities are based on the present value of the anticipated cash flows and approximate carrying value,
other than bonds issued. Fair value of bonds issued at 31 December 2014 was USD258 million (31
December 2013: USD910 million).
Derivatives: the fair value of derivative financial instruments, including embedded derivatives, is based
on quoted market prices. Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative
market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Group’s views
on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks
implicit in such estimates. Option-based derivatives are valued using Black-Scholes models and MonteCarlo simulations. The derivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair value at each reporting date.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
at the end of the reporting period, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy defined in IFRS 7,
Financial Instruments: Disclosures. It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial
liabilities not measured at fair value as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The levels are defined as follows:
Level 1 (highest level): fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical financial instruments.
Level 2: fair values measured using quoted prices in active markets for similar financial instruments,
or using valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly based on observable
market data.
Level 3 (lowest level): fair values measured using valuation techniques in which any significant input is not
based on observable market data.

(b) Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and trade payables. The main purpose
of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various financial
assets such as trade receivables and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk, liquidity risk,
foreign currency risk and credit risk. Management reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these
risks which are summarised below.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk
management framework. The Board has established a risk management group within its Department of
Internal Control, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group’s risk management policies.
The Department reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group,
to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management
policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and
constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk
management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in
relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Group’s Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by
the Group’s Internal Audit function which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management
controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
240

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

(c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
equity prices will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective
of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters,
while optimising returns.
(i)

Commodity price risk
During the years ended 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group has entered into certain long term
electricity contracts and other commodity derivatives contracts in order to manage its exposure of commodity
price risks. Details of the contracts are disclosed in note 29.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s
long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates (refer to note 26). The Group’s policy is to manage its
interest costs by monitoring changes in interest rates with respect to its borrowings.
The following table details the interest rate profile of the Group’s and the Company’s borrowings at the
reporting date.

obligation of USD107 million bearing interest at 8.50% per annum. This obligation represent the hedged
amount of rouble bonds (for detailed information, refer to note 27). Additionally, it includes a RUB18.3
billion credit facility, hedged with a cross-currency swap (for detailed information refer to note 29).

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to cash flows from interest rate risk arising from floating
rate non-derivative instruments held by the Group at the reporting date in respect of a reasonably possible
change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant. The impact on the Group’s profit before
taxation and equity and retained profits/accumulated losses is estimated as an annualised input on interest
expense or income of such a change in interest rates. The analysis has been performed on the same basis for
all years presented.

(iii) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a
currency other than the respective functional currencies of group entities, primarily USD but also the Russian
Rouble, Ukrainian Hryvna and Euros. The currencies in which these transactions primarily are denominated
are RUB, USD and EUR.
Borrowings are primarily denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying
operations of the Group, primarily USD but also RUB and EUR. This provides an economic hedge.
242

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures
that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when
necessary to address short-term imbalances or entering into currency swap arrangements.
The Group’s exposure at the reporting date to foreign currency risk arising from recognised assets and
liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity to which they relate is
set out in the table below. Differences resulting from the translation of the financial statements of foreign
operations into the Group’s presentation currency are ignored.

Results of the analysis as presented in the above tables represent an aggregation of the instantaneous
effects on the Group entities’ profit before taxation and other comprehensive income measured in the
respective functional currencies, translated into USD at the exchange rates ruling at the reporting date for
presentation purposes.
The sensitivity analysis assumes that the change in foreign exchange rates had been applied to remeasure those financial instruments held by the Group which expose the Group to foreign currency risk at
the reporting date. The analysis excludes differences that would result from the translation of other financial
statements of foreign operations into the Group’s presentation currency. The analysis has been performed
on the same basis for all years presented.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(d) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The group policy is to maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents or have available funding through an
adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet its operating and financial commitments.
The following tables show the remaining contractual maturities at the reporting date of the Group’s nonderivative financial liabilities, which are based on contractual undiscounted cash flows (including interest
payment computed using contractual rates, or if floating, based on rates current at the reporting date) and
the earliest the Group can be required to pay.

(e) Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all
customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The majority of the
Group’s third party trade receivables represent balances with the world’s leading international corporations
operating in the metals industry. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with
246

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

the result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. Goods are normally sold subject to
retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim. The
Group does not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables. The details of impairment
of trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 23. The extent of the Group’s credit exposure is
represented by the aggregate balance of financial assets and financial guarantees given.
At 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Group has certain concentrations of credit risk as 10.2% and
1.1% of the total trade receivables were due from the Group’s largest customer and 13.0% and 2.3% of the
total trade receivables were due from the Group’s five largest customers, respectively (refer to note 5 for the
disclosure on revenue from largest customer).
With respect to credit risk arising from guarantees, the Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees
only to wholly-owned subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. Management have recognised a provision
of USD100 million against the Group’s exposure to guarantees (refer to note 28(e)).
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as
a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic
conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market
confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return on
capital, which the Group defines as net operating income divided by total shareholders’ equity, excluding noncontrolling interests. The Board of Directors also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between higher returns that might be possible with higher levels
of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
The Company and its subsidiaries were subject to externally imposed capital requirements in the both
years presented in these consolidated financial statements.
(g) Master netting or similar agreements
The Group may enter into sales and purchase agreements with the same counterparty in the normal
course of business. The related amount receivable and payable do not always meet the criteria for
offsetting in the statement of financial position. This is because the Group may not have any currently legally
enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset may be enforceable only on the
occurrence of future events.
Due to changes in IAS 32 there are no financial instruments that meet the offsetting criteria in the
statement of financial position for the year ended 31 December 2014. Amount of USD35 million related
to recognised financial instruments that do not meet some or all of the offsetting criteria is included within
financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2014.
32 COMMITMENTS
(a) Capital commitments
In May 2006, the Group signed a Co-operation agreement with OJSC HydroOGK and RAO UES.
Under this Co-operation agreement OJSC HydroOGK and the Group have jointly committed to finance
the construction and future operating of the BEMO Project including BoGES and an aluminium plant,
the planned main customer of the hydropower station. The parties established two joint companies with
50:50 ownership, into which the Group is committed to invest USD1,215 million by the end of 2015
(31 December 2013: USD1,989 million). The Group has entered into contracts that result in contractual
obligations primarily relating to various construction and capital repair works. The commitments at
31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 approximated USD319 million and USD258 million,
respectively. These commitments are due over a number of years.
(b) Purchase commitments
Commitments with third parties for purchases of alumina, bauxite, other raw materials and other
purchases in 2015-2034 under supply agreements are estimated from USD3,400 million to USD3,962
million at 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: USD2,460 million to USD2,662 million) depending
on the actual purchase volumes and applicable prices.

Commitments with related parties for purchases of alumina, bauxite and other raw materials in 20152017 under supply agreements are estimated USD262 million at 31 December 2014.
(c) Sale commitments
Commitments with third parties for sales of alumina and other raw materials in 2015-2020 are estimated
from USD958 million to USD1,946 million at 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: from USD706
million to USD737 million) and will be settled at market prices at the date of delivery. Commitments with
related parties for sales of alumina in 2015-2019 approximated from USD852 million to USD1,324 million
at 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: from USD1,349 million to USD1,413 million).
Commitments with related parties for sales of primary aluminium and alloys in 2015-2021 are estimated
to range from USD5,780 million to USD6,690 million at 31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: from
USD4,930 million to USD5,566 million). Commitments with third parties for sales of primary aluminium
and alloys at 31 December 2014 are estimated to range from USD923 million to USD1,144 million (31
December 2013: from USD783 million to USD848 million). These commitments will be settled at market
price at the date of delivery. Commitments include sales to Glencore in accordance with a long-term
contract for which the sales volumes will depend on the actual production in 2015-2017. The volume of
sales commitments to Glencore for 2015 year under the agreement is specified and is estimated to be from
USD1,973 to USD2,053 million.

(e) Social commitments
The Group contributes to the maintenance and upkeep of the local infrastructure and the welfare of
its employees, including contributions toward the development and maintenance of housing, hospitals,
transport services, recreation and other social needs of the regions of the Russian Federation where the
Group’s production entities are located. The funding of such assistance is periodically determined by
management and is appropriately capitalised or expensed as incurred.
33 CONTINGENCIES
(a) Taxation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which
can occur frequently. Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and
activities of the Group may be challenged by the relevant local, regional and federal authorities. Notably
recent developments in the Russian environment suggest that the authorities in this country are becoming
more active in seeking to enforce, through the Russian court system, interpretations of the tax legislation, in
particular in relation to the use of certain commercial trading structures, which may be selective for particular
tax payers and different to the authorities’ previous interpretations or practices. Different and selective
interpretations of tax regulations by various government authorities and inconsistent enforcement create
further uncertainties in the taxation environment in the Russian Federation.
Tax declarations, together with related documentation, are subject to review and investigation by a
number of authorities, each of which may impose fines, penalties and interest charges. Fiscal periods remain
open to review by the authorities for three calendar years preceding the year of review (one year in the case
of customs). Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods. In addition, in some instances,
new tax regulations effectively have been given retroactive effect. Additional taxes, penalties and interest
248

which may be material to the financial position of the taxpayers may be assessed in the Russian Federation
as a result of such reviews.
In addition to the amounts of income tax the Group has provided, there are certain tax positions taken by
the Group where it is reasonably possible (though less than 50% likely) that additional tax may be payable
upon examination by the tax authorities or in connection with ongoing disputes with tax authorities. The
Group's best estimate of the aggregate maximum of additional amounts that it is reasonably possible may
become payable if these tax positions were not sustained at 31 December 2014 is USD357 million (31
December 2013: USD345 million).
The Group’s major trading companies are incorporated in low tax jurisdictions outside Russia and a
significant portion of the Group’s profit is realised by these companies. Management believes that these
trading companies are not subject to taxes outside their countries of incorporation and that the commercial
terms of transactions between them and other group companies are acceptable to the relevant tax
authorities. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on this basis. However, as these
companies are involved in a significant level of cross border activities, there is a risk that Russian or other tax
authorities may challenge the treatment of cross-border activities and assess additional tax charges. It is not
possible to quantify the financial exposure resulting from this risk.
New transfer pricing legislation enacted in the Russian Federation starting from 1 January 2012 provides
for major modifications making local transfer pricing rules closer to OECD guidelines, but creating additional
uncertainty in practical application of tax legislation in certain circumstances.
The new transfer pricing rules introduce an obligation for the taxpayers to prepare transfer pricing
documentation with respect to controlled transactions and prescribe new basis and mechanisms for accruing
additional taxes and interest in case prices in the controlled transactions differ from the market level. The new
transfer pricing rules eliminated the 20-percent price safe harbour that existed under the previous transfer
pricing rules applicable to transactions on or prior to 31 December 2011.
The new transfer pricing rules primarily apply to cross-border transactions between related parties, as
well as to certain cross-border transactions between independent parties, as determined under the Russian
Tax Code. In addition, the rules apply to in-country transactions between related parties if the accumulated
annual volume of the transactions between the same parties exceeds a particular threshold (RUB3 billion in
2012, RUB2 billion in 2013, and RUB1 billion in 2014 and thereon).
Since there is no practice of applying the new transfer pricing rules by the tax authorities and courts,
it is difficult to predict the effect, if any, of the new transfer pricing rules on these consolidated financial
statements.
The Company believes it is compliant with the new rules as it has historically applied the OECD -based
transfer pricing principles. Estimating additional tax which may become payable is inherently imprecise.
It is, therefore, possible that the amount ultimately payable may exceed the Group's best estimate of the
maximum reasonably possible liability; however, the Group considers that the likelihood that this will be the
case is remote.
The new controlled foreign company (“CFC”) rules have been introduced in Russia starting from 1
January 2015. The rules apply to undistributed profits of non-Russian CFC controlled by Russian tax-resident
shareholders. The Company is tax-resident in Cyprus and managed and controlled from Cyprus and the
new CFC rules shall not directly apply to the Group in relation to any of its non-Russian affiliates. The CFC
rules may apply to Russian tax-resident controlling shareholders of the Company, where such shareholder
controls more than 50% of the Company (starting from 2016 more than 25% or 10% where all Russian
tax-resident shareholders together control more than 50%). The rules also introduce certain reporting
requirements for such Russian tax-resident controlling shareholders of the Company starting from 2015 in
relation to non-Russian affiliates of the Group where such shareholders directly or indirectly control more
than 10% of those affiliates.
(b) Environmental contingencies
The Group and its predecessor entities have operated in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Jamaica,
Guyana, the Republic of Guinea and the European Union for many years and certain environmental
problems have developed. Governmental authorities are continually considering environmental
regulations and their enforcement and the Group periodically evaluates its obligations related thereto.
As obligations are determined, they are recognised immediately. The outcome of environmental liabilities
under proposed or any future legislation, or as a result of stricter enforcement of existing legislation,
cannot reasonably be estimated. Under current levels of enforcement of existing legislation, management
believes there are no possible liabilities, which will have a material adverse effect on the financial position
or the operating results of the Group. However, the Group anticipates undertaking significant capital
projects to improve its future environmental performance and to bring it into full compliance with current
legislation.

(c) Legal contingencies
The Group’s business activities expose it to a variety of lawsuits and claims which are monitored,
assessed and contested on the ongoing basis. Where management believes that a lawsuit or another
claim would result in the outflow of the economic benefits for the Group, a best estimate of such outflow is
included in provisions in the consolidated financial statements (refer to note 28). As at 31 December 2014
the amount of claims, where management assesses outflow as possible approximates USD111 million (31
December 2013: USD175 million).
In January 2013, the Company received a writ of summons and statement of claim filed in the High Court
of Justice of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria (Abuja) by plaintiff BFIG Group Divino Corporation
(“BFIG”) against certain subsidiaries of the Company. It is a claim for damages arising out of the defendants’
alleged tortious interference in the bid process for the sale of the Nigerian government’s majority stake in
the Aluminium Smelter Company of Nigeria (“ALSCON”) and alleged loss of BFIG’s earnings resulting from
its failed bid for the said stake in ALSCON. BFIG seeks compensatory damages in the amount of USD2.8
billion. The Company does not expect the case to have any material adverse effect on the Group’s financial
position or its operation as a whole.
(d) Risks and concentrations
A description of the Group’s major products and its principal markets, as well as exposure to foreign
currency risks are provided in note 1 “Background” and note 31 “Financial risk management and fair
values”. The price at which the Group can sell its products is one of the primary drivers of the Group’s
revenue. The Group’s prices are largely determined by prices set in the international market. The Group’s
future profitability and overall performance is strongly affected by the price of primary aluminium that is set
in the international market.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(e) Insurance
The insurance industry in the Russian Federation is in a developing stage and many forms of insurance
protection common in other parts of the world are not yet generally available. The Group does not have
full coverage for its plant facilities, business interruption or third party liability in respect of property or
environmental damage arising from accidents on Group properties or relating to Group operations. Until
the Group obtains adequate insurance coverage, there is a risk that the loss or destruction of certain assets
could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s operations and financial position.

35 PARTICULARS OF SUBSIDIARIES
As at 31 December 2014 and 2013, the Company has direct and indirect interests in the following
subsidiaries, which principally affected the results, assets and liabilities of the Group:

253

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Included in other liabilities is a payable for 1,600 ordinary shares newly issued by one of the Company’s
subsidiaries - RTI Limited on 12 February 2010 and redeemable at the option of that subsidiary. The nominal
value of the payable, which is repayable on demand not later 31 December 2017, is USD1,600 million.
Upon initial recognition, the fair value of the payable amounting to USD1,057 million was determined at
inception by discounting at applicable market interest rates. The carrying value of the payable balance as at
31 December 2014 is USD1,600 million (as at 31 December 2013: USD1,581 million).
The remainder of other liabilities represents a promissory note payable issued by the Company to its
subsidiary - RTI Limited in amount of USD553 million, bearing zero interest and repayable on demand
on or after 7 December 2013. Upon initial recognition the fair value of the payable was determined by
discounting at applicable interest rates at USD420 million, with the resultant difference between nominal
and fair value recorded directly in equity. During 2012 and 2011 this promissory note was partly repaid
in the amount of USD88 million and USD434 million, respectively. During 2013 this promissory note was
assigned from RTI Limited to Rusal Limited in the deferred amount of USD29 million. The nominal value of the
payable balance as at 31 December 2014 and 2013 is USD30 million.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

36 IMMEDIATE AND ULTIMATE CONTROLLING PARTY
At 31 December 2014 and 2013, the directors consider the immediate parent of the Group to be En+, which
is incorporated in Jersey with its registered office at 44 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, JE4 9WG. En+ is controlled by
Fidelitas International Investments Corp. (a company incorporated in Panama) through its wholly-owned subsidiary.
Mr. Oleg V. Deripaska is the founder, the trustee and a principal beneficiary of a discretionary trust, which controls
Fidelitas International Investments Corp. None of these entities produce financial statements available for public use.
37 EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE REPORTING DATE
There were no significant events subsequent to the reporting date.
38 ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
The Group has identified the following critical accounting policies under which significant judgements, estimates
and assumptions are made and where actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and
conditions and may materially affect financial results or the financial position reported in future periods.
Property, plant and equipment – recoverable amount
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, each asset or cash generating unit is evaluated
every reporting period to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indication
exists, a formal estimate of recoverable amount is performed and an impairment loss recognised to the
extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or
cash generating group of assets is measured at the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s
length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties and is generally determined as the present
value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset, including any
expansion prospects, and its eventual disposal.
256

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

Value in use is also generally determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows, but
only those expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and its eventual disposal.
Present values are determined using a risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the risks inherent
in the asset. Future cash flow estimates are based on expected production and sales volumes, commodity
prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), reserves (refer to
‘Bauxite reserve estimates’ below), operating costs, restoration and rehabilitation costs and future capital
expenditure. This policy requires management to make these estimates and assumptions which are subject
to risk and uncertainty; hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter these projections,
which may impact the recoverable amount of the assets. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying
value of the assets may be impaired and the impairment would be charged against the statement of income.
Inventories – net realisable value
The Group recognises write-downs of inventories based on an assessment of the net realisable value of
the inventories. A write-down is applied to the inventories where events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the net realisable value is less than cost. The determination of net realisable value requires the use of
judgement and estimates. Where the expectation is different from the original estimates, such difference will
impact the carrying value of the inventories and the write-down of inventories charged to the statement of
income in the periods in which such estimate has been changed.

Investments in associates and joint ventures – recoverable amount
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, each investment in an associate or joint venture
is evaluated every reporting period to determine whether there are any indications of impairment after
application of the equity method of accounting. If any such indication exists, a formal estimate of recoverable
amount is performed and an impairment loss recognised to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an investment in an associate or joint venture is measured
at the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Similar considerations to those described above in respect of assessing the recoverable amount
of property, plant and equipment apply to investments in associates or joint venture. In addition to the
considerations described above the Group may also assess the estimated future cash flows expected to arise
from dividends to be received from the investment, if such information is available and considered reliable.
Legal proceedings
In the normal course of business the Group may be involved in legal proceedings. Where management
considers that it is more likely than not that proceedings will result in the Group compensating third parties a
provision is recognised for the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid. Where management considers
that it is more likely than not that proceedings will not result in the Group compensating third parties or where,
in rare circumstances, it is not considered possible to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount
expected to be paid, no provision is made for any potential liability under the litigation but the circumstances
and uncertainties involved are disclosed as contingent liabilities. The assessment of the likely outcome of legal
proceedings and the amount of any potential liability involves significant judgement. As law and regulations
in many of the countries in which the Group operates are continuing to evolve, particularly in the areas of
taxation, sub-soil rights and protection of the environment, uncertainties regarding litigation and regulation are
greater than those typically found in countries with more developed legal and regulatory frameworks.
Provision for restoration and rehabilitation
The Group’s accounting policies require the recognition of provisions for the restoration and rehabilitation of each
site when a legal or constructive obligation exists to dismantle the assets and restore the site. The provision recognised
represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future costs required. Significant estimates and
assumptions are made in determining the amount of restoration and rehabilitation provisions. Those estimates and
assumptions deal with uncertainties such as: changes to the relevant legal and regulatory framework; the magnitude
of possible contamination and the timing, extent and costs of required restoration and rehabilitation activity. These
uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided.
257

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Goodwill – recoverable amount
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, goodwill is allocated to the Group’s Aluminium
segment as it represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes and is tested for impairment annually by preparing a formal estimate of the
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is estimated as the value in use of the Aluminium segment.
Similar considerations to those described above in respect of assessing the recoverable amount of
property, plant and equipment apply to goodwill.

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

The provision recognised for each site is periodically reviewed and updated based on the facts and
circumstances available at the time. Changes to the estimated future costs for operating sites are recognised
in the statement of financial position by adjusting both the restoration and rehabilitation asset and provision.
Such changes give rise to a change in future depreciation and interest charges. For closed sites, changes to
estimated costs are recognised immediately in the statement of income.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Taxation
The Group’s accounting policy for taxation requires management’s judgement in assessing whether
deferred tax assets and certain deferred tax liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position.
Deferred tax assets, including those arising from carried forward tax losses, capital losses and temporary
differences, are recognised only where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered,
which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities arising
from temporary differences in investments, caused principally by retained earnings held in foreign tax
jurisdictions, are recognised unless repatriation of retained earnings can be controlled and is not expected
to occur in the foreseeable future.
Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits and repatriation of retained earnings depend
on management’s estimates of future cash flows. These depend on estimates of future production and
sales volumes, commodity prices, reserves, operating costs, restoration and rehabilitation costs, capital
expenditure, dividends and other capital management transactions. Assumptions are also required about the
application of income tax legislation. These estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty,
hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the
amount of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities recognised on the statement of financial position
and the amount of other tax losses and temporary differences not yet recognised. In such circumstances,
some or all of the carrying amount of recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment,
resulting in a corresponding credit or charge to the statement of income.
The Group generally provides for current tax based on positions taken (or expected to be taken) in its tax
returns. Where it is more likely than not that upon examination by the tax authorities of the positions taken by
the Group additional tax will be payable, the Group provides for its best estimate of the amount expected to
be paid (including any interest and/or penalties) as part of the tax charge.
Bauxite reserve estimates
Reserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the
Group’s properties. In order to calculate reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about a range of
geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery
rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices and exchange rates.
The Group determines ore reserves under the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and
Ore Reserves September 1999, known as the JORC Code. The JORC Code requires the use of reasonable
investment assumptions to calculate reserves.
Estimating the quantity and/or grade of reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies or
fields to be determined by analysing geological data such as drilling samples. This process may require
complex and difficult geological judgements and calculations to interpret the data.
Since economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from period to period, and since additional
geological data is generated during the course of operations, estimates of reserves may change from period to period.
Changes in reported reserves may affect the Group’s financial results and financial position in a number
of ways, including the following:
• Asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in estimated future cash flows.
• Depletion charged in the statement of income may change where such charges are determined by the
units of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change.
• Decommissioning, site restoration and environmental provisions may change where changes in estimated
reserves affect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in certain items of
expenditure being capitalised for an area of interest where it is considered likely to be recoverable by future
exploitation or sale or where the activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment
of the existence of reserves. This policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as
to future events and circumstances, in particular whether an economically viable extraction operation can
be established. Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes available.
If, after having capitalised the expenditure under the policy, a judgement is made that recovery of the
expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised amount will be written off to the statement of income.
258

TAMING THE CHALLENGE | ANNUAL REPORT 2014 | UC RUSAL

Development expenditure
Development activities commence after project sanctioning by the appropriate level of management.
Judgement is applied by management in determining when a project has reached a stage at which economically
recoverable reserves exist such that development may be sanctioned. In exercising this judgement, management
is required to make certain estimates and assumptions similar to those described above for capitalised exploration
and evaluation expenditure. Any such estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes
available. If, after having commenced the development activity, a judgement is made that a development asset is
impaired, the appropriate amount will be written off to the statement of income.
Defined benefit pension and other post retirement schemes
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of benefits charged to the statement of income includes
current and past service costs, interest costs on defined benefit obligations and the effect of any curtailments
or settlements, net of expected returns on plan assets. An asset or liability is consequently recognised in the
statement of financial position based on the present value of defined obligations, less any unrecognised past
service costs and the fair value of plan assets.
The accounting policy requires management to make judgements as to the nature of benefits provided
by each scheme and thereby determine the classification of each scheme. For defined benefit pension
schemes, management is required to make annual estimates and assumptions about future returns on classes
of scheme assets, future remuneration changes, employee attrition rates, administration costs, changes
in benefits, inflation rates, exchange rates, life expectancy and expected remaining periods of service of
employees. In making these estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided by external
advisers, such as actuaries. Where actual experience differs to these estimates, actuarial gains and losses
are recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.

The IASB has issued the following amendments, new standards and interpretations which are not yet
effective in respect of the financial years included in these consolidated financial statements, and which have
not been adopted in these consolidated financial statements.
The Group is in the process of making an assessment of what the impact of these amendments, new
standards and new interpretations is expected to be in the period of initial application but is not yet in a
position to state whether these amendments, new standards and interpretations would have a significant
impact on the Group’s results of operations and financial position.

BETWEEN MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS

VETO RIGHTS
– The Major Shareholders have agreed to exercise
their voting rights with a view to giving the Major
Shareholders effective veto rights as set out
below, by procuring that Directors proposed by
them for appointment vote against any resolution
in respect of which a Major Shareholder has
exercised its “veto”:
– Each of En+, Glencore, SUAL Partners and
Onexim is given an effective right of veto
in relation to any related party transaction
(or amendment to or renewal of an existing
related party transaction).
– Each of En+, Glencore and SUAL Partners
and Onexim is given an effective right of
veto in respect of any matter proposed to
be undertaken by the Company or any
of its subsidiaries which would require a
special resolution were the Company or the
relevant subsidiary incorporated in England
and Wales (e.g., alteration of Articles of
Association; change of name; re-registration
of a private company as a public company;
re-registration of an unlimited company as
limited; reregistration of a public company as
a private company; offer to issue shares or
rights to subscribe for shares other than pro
rata to existing shareholders by disapplying
statutory pre-emption rights; reduction of
share capital; to give, revoke, renew or vary
the authority for the Company to purchase
(off market) shares in itself; and to redeem or
purchase own shares out of capital).
– The Company does not believe that these veto
rights will have any material impact on the
operation of the Company.
MATTERS INCONSISTENT WITH THE
SHAREHOLDERS’ AGREEMENT BETWEEN
MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS ONLY
The Major Shareholders have agreed that they
shall use their voting and other rights available to
them to procure that no resolutions are passed or
actions taken or refrained from being taken by the
Company or any other member of the Group to the
extent that they would be inconsistent with the terms

their voting and other rights available to them

into between the Group and KraMZ group
companies, a group of companies owned by Mr.
Deripaska are passed in accordance with those
laws and rules.
– If the entry into, amendment of or exercise of any
rights under any agreements between the Group
and Glencore approved by the Board require
shareholder approval under the Listing Rules,
the Major Shareholders have agreed to use
their voting and other rights available to them to
procure that such approvals and resolutions are
passed in accordance with those laws and rules.
DIVIDEND POLICY
The Major Shareholders have agreed to procure
compliance by the Group with a dividend policy, to
the extent permissible under the terms of the credit
facility agreements, under which not less than 50%
of the annual consolidated net profits of the Group in

within four months after the end of the relevant
financial year, subject to any applicable legislation.

wishes to sell any of its holding of Shares in an
on-market transaction, it must serve notice on
En+, offering it a right of first refusal. The price at
which En+ will be entitled to acquire the Shares
offered by SUAL Partners is the volume weighted

days prior to the date on which the relevant
notice is sent by SUAL Partners.
– SUAL Partners will not be obliged to offer En+ a
right of first refusal in respect of Shares sold by it
to the extent that:

one trading day by SUAL Partners does not

issue at the time of the relevant sale.

consideration for the acquisition by the Company of
a stake of 25% plus one share in Norilsk Nickel.

undertake a bookbuild placing or underwritten
offering of Shares of in excess of 1% of the
issued share capital of the Company, the Major
Shareholders have agreed to use their voting and

NO MANDATORY OFFER

to acquire or dispose of any voting rights which
would be exercisable at a general meeting of the
Company, if such acquisition or disposal would

Kong Codes on Takeovers and Mergers and Share
Repurchases to make an offer for Shares and have
undertaken to indemnify each other in the event of a
breach of such undertaking.
LICENCES
For as long as Onexim is a shareholder, En+,
SUAL Partners and Glencore have agreed not to,
and to use their respective voting and other rights
to procure that neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries will, bid for or acquire, and that the
Company will take reasonable steps to procure that
Norilsk Nickel will not bid for or acquire, certain
specified geological licences relating to nickel,
copper, platinum and cobalt without the prior written
consent of Onexim.
