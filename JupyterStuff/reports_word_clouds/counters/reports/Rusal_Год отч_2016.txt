Chairman’s
Statement

2

Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to report that 2016 was a year of
progress for the Company. During the period,
RUSAL achieved robust earnings and continued to execute its growth strategy. This was
accomplished despite the year being marked
by a turbulent external environment and is a
testament to RUSAL’s efficient business model,
operational success and focus on our key priorities.

RUSAL’s key priorities are described below:

Priority 1 - Maintaining the Company’s
position as one of the most efficient and
lowest cost producers worldwide

RUSAL continued to focus on operational efficiency and improvement at every level across
the business – from bauxite mining and aluminium smelting to logistics and our sales netThis focus on key strategic priorities meant work. These improvements had a positive imthat RUSAL was not only able to navigate a pact on our business and helped us to achieve
period of volatile prices, but was also able to solid results. During the year, our cash cost

lion with a healthy EBITDA margin of 18.65%.
We will continue to implement the RUSAL business system which ensures that the most efficient production practices are closely followed.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

11

Priority 2: Increasing sales of value
added products (VAP). Further
strengthening RUSAL’s position in key
markets including Europe, Asia and the
United States, further sales growth
in its domestic market
In 2016 RUSAL increased its sales of VAP by
impressive 7% YoY and made an important investment into VAP in order to support its expansion. At the Sayanogorsk smelter, a project
to produce 120,000 tonnes of alloys is nearing
completion. At Krasnoyarsk smelter, two largescale projects to produce billets and slabs are
progressing to plan. During 2016, the Company developed new types of VAP products and
improved the quality of some existing products. Our regional network expanded with the
opening of offices in Singapore and Seoul. The
Russian market also ended the year on a high
note. The recently adopted government program to boost demand for high added value
aluminium products was supported by the efforts undertaken by the Russian Aluminium
association, and the establishment of Aluminium Valley in Siberia. In addition, an overall
improvement in Russia’s economic outlook
indicates positive prospects for the ‘winged
metal’ in the region.

Priority 3: Focus on innovation
and technological development

Priority 4: Improving the existing capital
structure: (1) further reducing financial
debt; (2) stable payment of dividends
in line with the approved dividend policy
In April 2016, the Company announced that
it had made progress on its debt refinancing.
Following the announcement, RUSAL completed the prepayment of debt to the amount of
USD524 million. Post the end of the reporting period, in February 2017 RUSAL completed
its debut offering Eurobonds with a principal
amount of USD600 million and tenor of 5 years.
The success of this transaction is testament
to RUSAL’s credit strength and its name recognition within the investor community which
builds on its IPO several years ago.
In September 2016 the Board of Directors of
the Company approved an interim dividend
to the aggregate amount of USD250 million
(USD0.01645 per ordinary share) for the financial year ending 31 December 2016. The
interim dividend was paid on 31 October 2016
obtaining prior consents from certain lenders
of the Company.

Priority 5: Responsible approach to use
of natural resources and commitment
to climate change goals

RUSAL takes seriously its responsibility for addressing regional and global environmental isA key breakthrough during the year was the sues and finding cutting edge approaches to
launch of ultra-high power RA-550 cells with solving such problems. All at RUSAL believe

Finally, I would like to highlight RUSAL’s active role in addressing social challenges in the
regions in which we operate. Total charitable
donations and investment into social programs reached USD13.8 million in FY2016. Of
particular note is the Company’s initiative to
support the Guinean government in the fight
against Ebola.
I would like to thank our shareholders, employees, board members and all stakeholders for their
commitment and support over the year.
Looking to the year ahead, global aluminium
demand is expected to rise by 5.0% YoY with
the aluminium deficit widening to 1.1 million
tonnes. The outlook and prospects for the sector are therefore positive. Thanks to the work
undertaken by the Company, we are very well
positioned for the future and look to the year
ahead with confidence.

CEO’s
Review

Despite a challenging start to the year, with
aluminium prices reaching multi-year lows,
RUSAL achieved a solid financial performance
in 2016. On the one hand, we saw improved
market conditions in the second half of the year,
supporting our key performance metrics and
on the other, our strong results were down to
our dedication to cost management, production
discipline, and a stronger focus on innovation
and value added products development.

3

In 2016, RUSAL’s core businesses were stable
and performed according to plan. Our primary
aluminium production in 2016 was flat and totaled 3,685 thousand tonnes (+1.1% when compared to the previous year), alumina production totaled 7,528 thousand tonnes (+1.7%,)
and bauxite extraction was 12,187 thousand
tonnes (+0.6%).

We made very good progress in further reducing our aluminium cash cost per tonne
Although RUSAL’s revenue of USD7,983 mil- to USD1,333 which is 8.4% lower than last
lion was lower than the prior-year figures, we year’s average. Furthermore, thanks to our

and recurring net profit of USD1.26 billion (up adjusted EBITDA of USD1.49 billion with a
healthy EBITDA margin of 18.65% despite a
from USD1.10 billion).
3.5% average decrease in the London Metals
Exchange aluminium price and a 43.4% drop
in the average realized premiums other than
the LME price.

15

In 2016 we achieved USD1.24 billion of net
cash flows generated from operating activities. The scale and integrated nature of our
cash flow provide us with confidence regarding the Company’s future capital investments
and ability to service debts.
I would also like to highlight that post the reporting period, RUSAL completed its debut offering of a 5-year Eurobond with a principal
amount of USD600 million. While the bond
proceeds were used to refinance some of RUSAL’s existing pre-export finance facility and
improve the Company’s debt maturity profile,
the successful debut placement is testament
to RUSAL’s credit strength and its name recognition in the investor community.
We believe that RUSAL’s solid track record and
our motivation in developing customer solutions, from standard sales to new and innovative products and services, are the qualities
that differ us from our competitors. To provide
a better service and integration with our customers, we will further increase the share of
value-added products aiming at 55% of VAP
share in total sales by 2020. In order to expand our VAP proposition, we invested into
new casthouse projects at our Krasnoyarsk
and Khakas smelters, with new products expected to be shipped to customers in 2017.

Developing and operating cutting-edge technologies is one of our key strengths. A milestone achievement of the previous year was
the launch of the superpower RA-550 cell running at over 550 kA at our Sayanogorsk smelter. RUSAL’s proprietary technology counters a
major drawback of superpower cells which, in
most cases, lose efficiency or increase energy
consumption as amperage increases. RUSAL’s
commitment to improve its energy efficiency
across its production chain will work alongside
achieving its climate change goals of aiming to
be among the most efficient low carbon aluminium producers worldwide. Further activities are underway to evaluate the full resource
potential and curb our carbon footprint. For
example, a new environmentally friendly inert
anode technology is currently in the process
of development by RUSAL’s in-house R&D unit.
Alongside technological modernization of our
production facilities, we will continue to enhance
our portfolio in order to improve our financial
profile and flexibility. For instance, in 2016 the
Company completed the sale of a 100% stake
in Alumina Partners of Jamaica (‘Alpart’) to the
Chinese state industrial group, JIUQUAN IRON
& STEEL Co. Ltd. (‘JISCO’) receiving USD299
million cash from the transaction.

Looking ahead, we will continue to upgrade

As we continue into 2017, we expect the aluminium market to remain in good shape with demand increasing by 5% and global market deficit
widening to 1.1 million tonnes mostly due to the
market recovery, production discipline across the
industry and capacity limitations in China, where
a new antipollution plan developed by the Government will come into force.
I would like to thank all our employees and
stakeholders for their ongoing support and
commitment.

BEMO Project

The BEMO Project involves the construction
of the 3,000 MW Boguchanskaya Hydropower Plant and the BEMO aluminium smelter in
the Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia, which is
expected to produce approximately 600 kt of
aluminium per annum.
The construction of the BEMO aluminium
smelter is divided into two stages (each one
for 298 kt of aluminium per annum). The startup complex of the first stage (149 kt of aluminium per annum, 168 pots) was launched in
2015 and the second part of this stage (149 kt
of aluminium per annum, 168 pots) is scheduled for completion at the end of 2018.
The capital expenditure for the first stage of
BEMO aluminium smelter (capacity 298 kt per
annum), incurred and to be incurred, is currently estimated at approximately USD1,612
million (UC RUSAL’s share of such capital
expenditure is expected to be approximately USD806 million), of which approximately
USD1,329 million has been incurred as of 31
December 2016 (of which UC RUSAL’s share
amounted to approximately USD662 million).
Actual capital expenditure for the BEMO aluminium smelter in 2016 was USD65.74 million (of which UC RUSAL’s share amounted to
USD32.87 million).

Alumina

The Group owns 10 alumina refineries as at end
of 2016. Nine of UC RUSAL’s alumina refineries
are located in six countries: Ireland (one plant),
Jamaica (one plant), Ukraine (one plant), Italy
(one plant), Russia (four plants) and Guinea
(one plant). In addition, the Company holds a
20% equity stake in QAL, an alumina refinery
located in Australia. In the end of 2016 100%
share of Alpart (Jamaica) was sold. As a result of that, RUSAL’s alumina production capacity had decreased by 1,650 thousand tonnes
compare to 2015. Most of the Group’s refineries have ISO 9001 certified quality control systems. Four refineries and QAL have been ISO
14001 certified for their environmental management and three refineries have received
OHSAS 18001 certification for their health and
safety management system.
The Company’s long position in alumina capacity helps to secure sufficient supply for the prospective expansion of the Company’s aluminium
production capacity and allows the Company
to take advantage of favourable market conditions through third-party alumina sales.

With energy being a major cost item, all of the
Alumina Division plants were involved in major
energy savings programs during 2016. In addition to that, a number of other important projects have been implemented to achieve cost
savings and increase competitiveness including:

Achinsk Alumina Refinery. A program of
partial substitution of costly bright coal by
the ligneous coal for sintering purposes is
ongoing. In 2016 a new Loesche mill for
ligneous coal was installed. Lower quality nepheline involved was increased in
2016 up to 1,076 thousand tonnes, which
reduced alumina production costs. Slag
processing field test was ongoing with 47
thousand tonnes involved in production.
Residue disposal area #3 construction
project was completed, expecting end of
commissioning in Q2 2017.
Urals Alumina Refinery. A capacity increasing program is ongoing. The construction of continuous digester module
#2 was completed with new two digester
lines planned to be commissioned in early
2017. Two new precipitator tanks were
built in 2016 and commissioned in early
2017 and two new KraussMaffei hydrate
seed filters were installed and commissioned in 2016, increasing capacity to 900
thousand tonnes from Q2 2017. Production capacity increased by 84 thousand
tonnes.
Bogoslovsk Alumina Refinery. A complex
1,030 thousand tonnes capacity rehabilitation program was completed in 2016.
Nikolaev Alumina Refinery. First stage of
the 1,700 thousand tonnes capacity increasing program was accomplished in
2016 by building precipitation train #5
with the expected completion of whole
program in late 2017. Production capacity
increased by 29 thousand tonnes.

Aughinish Alumina Refinery. Numbers of
developmental and organizational activities were deployed for expected Dian-Dian blend, conceptual study was done.
Windalco. The sands removal project is
in its development stage with expected
completion in 2017-2018. The second
tube heater was installed and commissioned in the end of 2016. Major instrumentation and DCS system rehabilitation
program was prepared. Boiler #2 foundation major repair was completed. Audit of
turbo-generators #2 and #3 was done by
General Electric, with expected major repairs of both sets in 2017.
Increased alumina output at QAL was
caused by repair schedule correction and
by additional output accounting in 2016
based on commission decision regarding
alumina weighting error in 2015.

Bauxite

The Group operates seven bauxite mines. UC
RUSAL’s bauxite mines are located in four
countries: Russia (two mines), Jamaica (one
mine), Guyana (one mine) and Guinea (two
mines and one project). In the end of 2016,
100% share of Alpart (Jamaica) was sold. As
a result of that, RUSAL’s bauxite production
capacity had decreased by 4.9 million tonnes
in comparison to 2015. The Company’s long
position in bauxite capacity helps to secure
sufficient supply for the prospective expansion
of the Company’s alumina production capacity
and allows the Company to take advantage of
favourable market conditions through thirdparty bauxite sales.
The first stage of construction of the new shaft
of the Cheremukhovskaya Glubokaya pit that
has been completed at “North Urals Bauxite
Mine’ which will allow steadily developed extraction thereby in spite of the pit Krasnaya
Shapochka which was exhausted in 2016.
Intense construction activities regarding development of the new deposit Dian-Dian continued in 2016.

BEMO Project

BEMO HPP is the fourth step of the Angara
hydroelectric power chain, the biggest major hydro-power plant completion project in
Russia. Construction of the power plant was
suspended in Soviet times due to the lack of
financing and was resumed in May 2006 by
UC RUSAL and RusHydro following the conclusion of their agreement to jointly implement
the BEMO project comprising the BEMO HPP
(the average annual electricity output reaching 17.6 billion kWh) and an aluminium smelter capable of producing 600,000 tonnes of
metal per year.
The project’s 79 metres high, 2,587 metres long composite gravity and rock-fill dam
was completed at the end of 2011 and nine
333 MW hydropower units of the BEMO HPP
were put into operation during 2012-2014.
The total installed capacity of all nine hydrounits in operation amounts to 2,997 MW.
All nine 333 MW turbines and generators were
supplied by OJSC Power Machines, under contracts worth more than RUB6 billion signed in
December 2006 and September 2007, respectively. The turbines for the project are among the
largest ever manufactured in Russia by weight
and dimensions: each runner in 7.86 meters in
diameter and weighs 155.6 tonnes.

UC RUSAL’s proportion of capital expenditure
for the BEMO Project is 50%. The total capital
expenditure for the BEMO HPP, incurred and
to be incurred, is currently estimated to be
approximately USD2,116 million5 (UC RUSAL’s
share of this capital expenditure is expected
to be approximately USD1,058 million), of
which USD2,085 million had been spent as of
31 December 2016 (of which UC RUSAL’s share
amounted to USD1,042 million).

Mining Assets

UC RUSAL’s mining assets comprise 15 mines
and mine complexes, including bauxite mines
(the resources of which are described above),
two quartzite mines, one fluorite mine, two
coal mines, one nepheline syenite mine and
two limestone mines.
The Company jointly operates the two coal
mines with Samruk-Energo, the energy division
of Samruk-Kazyna under a 50/50 joint venture,
Bogatyr Coal LLP. The long position in alumina
capacity is supported by the Company’s bauxite and nepheline syenite resource base.

Bogatyr Coal LLP

Bogatyr Coal LLP, which is located in Kazakhstan, is a 50/50 joint venture between the
Company and Samruk-Energo.

The plant has started commercial supplies to
the wholesale electricity and capacity market on 1 December 2012. Since its launch the
BEMO HPP has generated 40.725 TWh of electricity. During 2016, the plant has supplied
13.970 TWh to the wholesale electricity and
capacity market.

All capital expenditure amounts given above
for the BEMO project are based on UC RUSAL’s management accounts and differ from
amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, as the management accounts
reflect the latest best estimate of the capital
5

26

costs required to complete the project, whereas amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements reflect actual capital commitments as at 31 December 2016. All figures
for the BEMO project are exclusive of VAT.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

Bogatyr Coal LLP, which produced approximately 35.05 mt of coal in 2016, has approximately 1.83 billion tonnes of JORC Proved and
Probable Ore Reserves and has Measured Mineral Resources and Indicated Mineral Resources in aggregate of approximately 0.4 billion
tonnes as at 31 December 2016.
Bogatyr Coal LLP generated sales of approximately USD254 million in 2015 and USD187
million in 2016 6. Sales are divided approximately as to one third and two thirds, respectively, between Russian and Kazakh customers based on the quantities sold. The fall of
the average exchange rate of KZT to USD from
221.73 to 342.16 during 2015-2016 years led
to lower sales in dollars.

Investment in Norilsk Nickel

Norilsk Nickel is the world’s largest nickel and
palladium producer and one of the leading

held 27.82% shareholding in Norilsk Nickel as
at the Latest Practicable Date.

Company profile8

Norilsk Nickel is the world leader in production of nickel and palladium. Norilsk Nickel’s
Resource Base in Taimyr and Kola Peninsula
as of 31 December 2015, consists of 843 mt
of Proved Ore Reserves and Probable Ore Reserves and 2,173 mt of Measured Mineral Resources and Indicated Mineral Resources. Its
key assets are located in Norilsk region and
Kola Peninsula in Russia, with foreign assets
located in Finland and South Africa.
In 2016, Norilsk Nickel produced 236 kt of
nickel, 360 kt of copper, 2,618 koz of palladium and 644 koz of platinum. Compared to
2015 there was a planned reduction in production of Nickel (-12%), Copper (-2%) and PGM
(-3% Palladium, -2% Platinum) which was
driven mostly by decommissioning of Nickel
Plant, increasing of work-in-progress in transit
as a part of ongoing reconfiguration of metallurgical production facilities, as well as modernization of Talnakh Concentrating Plant and
lower copper content in mined ore.

UC RUSAL’s shareholding in Norilsk Nickel allows for significant diversification of earnings,
through Norilsk Nickel’s exposure to PGMs7 and
bulk materials, and also broadens UC RUSAL’s

shall be determined on the basis of the ratio
of Norilsk Nickel’s Net Debt to Norilsk Nickel’s
EBITDA as of 31 December of the preceding
year as follows:

1)

The parties must ensure that annual
dividend paid by Norilsk Nickel from
2016 onward (“Subsequent Agreed Dividend”) shall be in an amount equal to
50% of EBITDA for the year preceding
the year in which the dividends are paid,
but no less than USD2 billion and to be
calculated in US Dollars using the Bank
of Russia’s exchange rate for the date
the board of directors of Norilsk Nickel
passes a resolution on the recommended
amount of the dividends.

2)

The amount of Subsequent Agreed Dividend can be decreased at the discretion
of the Managing Partner of Norilsk Nickel
if the amount of dividends, actually distributed in preceding period(s) (starting
from 2016), exceeds respective EBITDA
Dividend (being 50 % EBITDA for the
previous year but no less than USD2 billion) — within the amount of such excess.

3)

If during any year commercially reasonable opportunity emerges to distribute
dividends more than twice a year and
the investors agree with such payment
schedule, there is a soft undertaking of
the Managing Partner of Norilsk Nickel to
schedule pay-outs of dividends more frequently than twice a year.

Group-Wide Initiatives
Innovations and Scientific Projects

The Company successfully launched ultra-high
power RA-550 pots with the best environmental and power indicators for this type of pots
at SAZ. Technical solutions envisaged by the
project help to solve to the extent possible
the key global problem relating to ramping
up the production capacity and amperage of
ultra-high power pots to 700, 800 and over
1000 kA. The target electricity consumption is
11,800 kWh/t, net of busbar. To support this
landmark project of the Company, the Industry
Development Fund of the Ministry of Industry
and Trade of the Russian Federation provided
a preferential loan amounting to RUB500 million, as well as to achieve and improve the indicators of pots, the Ministry of Education and
Science of the Russian Federation allocated a
grant of RUB170 million for work in this area
together with the Siberian Federal University.

32

The switch of smelters to Green Soderberg
technology is continued. Installed Green
Soderberg pots confirmed high environmental
and process indicators, as well as economic
efficiency of the switch with minimum costs.
The Company is completing the switch of pots
at KrAZ, the Green Soderberg design has been
proven for a pilot potroom to convert BrAZ
to the new technology, and pilot designs to
upgrade NkAZ and IrkAZ have also been installed. The new technology allows radically
reducing emissions of fluorides, dust and tars,
as well as decreasing power consumption and
increasing efficiency.
As part of the Company’s mainstream to reduce carbon footprint, it is successfully testing the technology of using inert anodes at a
pilot pot with the amperage of 140 kA. The
technology provides for complete prevention
of greenhouse gas emissions at the aluminium
production and oxygen generation. Key work
areas during the year were related to selecting optimal technological process parameters
to test technical solutions intended to improve
and stabilise reduction process indicators and
minimise pot maintenance operations. Researches and tests involving customers were
carried out, and new types of alloys were developed based on unique Green Aluminium
produced using inert anodes. The researches
and tests were supported (co-funded) by the
State Program of the Ministry of Education and
Science of the Russian Federation ‘Research
and Development in Priority Growth Areas of
Russian Science and Technology Sector for
2014-2020’.
To reduce the volume of storage at the solid
waste landfill, 3 breakthrough projects were
successfully implemented:
ontinued deploying of the technology
c
of pot lining with unshaped carbon materials, which replaced over 50% of the
refractory lining part and allowed recycling up to 60% of the materials. In addition to the environmental component,
the project enables reducing relining
costs due to the usage of cheaper lining materials and their recycling, as well
as decreasing the time of relining. The
technology is successfully implemented
at S175 pots of SAZ. Solutions were
successfully tested to deploy the technology to S255 pots at SAZ and Green
Soderberg at KrAZ. It was decided to
implement them during relining and apply at BrAZ, NkAZ and IrkAZ pots.
Creating value / Annual report 2016

successfully tested technology to pro
cess carbon components of pot lining for
production of marketable products: bath
for smelters and carbon concentrate for
cement production facilities and alumina refineries. The project is supported
through financing of researches by a
grant from the Ministry of Education and
Science of the Russian Federation.
ommissioned pilot facility for sulphur
c
extraction from solutions of fume treatment centers capturing sulphur from
reduction fumes in the fluoride processing area at KrAZ, which allowed effectively running the second stage of fume
treatment and achieving the highest
efficiency of fume treatment among its
analogues, as well as decreasing the
hazard level of stored waste and, moreover, producing a marketable product –
sodium sulphate. Tests confirmed ability of the facility to process the entire
fume treatment volume at KrAZ. Sulphur storage logistics were organised.
Quality indicators are being confirmed
with customers to produce the marketable product.
To improve the energy efficiency of aluminium production, the Company developed and
tested energy-efficient pot designs and decided to implement various designs of pots at
KrAZ, SAZ and IrkAZ in order to reduce power
consumption by 300-800 kWh/t of Al. The energy consumption of 12,800 kWh/t of Al was
achieved at OA300 pots, one of the best indicators for pots of this type. As part of energy
efficiency measures at RA-167 pots of NkAZ,
an energy-efficient collector beam was developed for testing that would allow reducing the
electricity consumption by 10-15% and fume
suction by over 50%.
A technology was developed for low-temperature thermal solution of goal generating
environment-friendly pitch to replace pitch of
coke production with the alternative binding
agent having a low price and low benzapyrene content.
A 15 kg/day test line was created that produced coal pitch samples with 5-10-fold lower
benzapyrene content in pitch. Technical solutions were developed to produce environmentfriendly pitch with calculated costs of around
USD250 per tonne.

To develop new products, the Company mounted a pilot facility to produce aluminium-scandium (Al-Sc) alloys that would allow producing
alloys compliant with international standards
ranging from alloyed metal (0.2-0.5% of Sc)
to alloys containing 2-3% of Sc. Due to the developed solutions, with the best quality indicators among current producers of Al-Sc alloys,
costs of these alloys are materially lower than
those of its existing analogues that will enable
the Company to take its rightful place among
producers of ultra-hard aluminium alloys demonstrating excellent weldability and corrosionresistance properties. The Ministry of Industry
and Trade of the Russian Federation provided
a subsidy of RUB145 million to research the
technology of Al-Sc alloy production and organise pilot tests. Further, it is planned to create
a pilot production for up to 15 tonnes per year.
Lean-alloyed Al-Sc alloys were developed and
qualified with European customers in 2016.
The scandium concentration was reduced
2-2.5 fold versus traditional alloys, while parity ratios of mechanical properties remained
unchanged.
Irkutsk Aluminium Smelter commissioned a
unit of combined processes to produce wire
rod of aluminium and aluminium alloys SLIPP.
Commissioning of this unit allows extending
the range of wire rod produced in the Company in a considerable manner. In terms of its
CAPEX/output ratio, SLIPP is significantly superior to traditional wire rod production lines.
To extend the product mix, lines of new generation foundry and wrought alloys were developed; they could be produced using aluminium
based both on standard and innovative reduction technologies, including the inert anode
reduction technology.
As part of this project, Al-Fe-Ni and Al-Fe-Ca
high-strength foundry alloys for production
of automobile components were developed in
2016. These alloys were tested in pilot production of automobile wheels.
A technology was developed and tested to
produce wrought semis of high-strength alloys
by hot moulding and rolling methods. Lots of
products were produced with the level of properties by 10% better than 7075 alloy.

Aluminium

At all aluminium smelters (hereinafter referred to as ‘smelters’) of UC RUSAL, energy
efficiency improvement projects were implemented: the electricity consumption in average for the Company decreased by 40kWh/t
and the current efficiency increased by 0.02%
versus 2015.
The switch of smelters applying the baked anode
technology to unified baked anodes was completed: the specific consumption of baked anodes (gross) decreased by 1 kg/t versus 2015.
Measures focused on improving the Soderberg
anode technology and anode paste production technology allowed decreasing the anode
paste consumption by 3.0 kg/t versus 2015.
Implementing new materials for pot relining
and improving the pot start and maintenance
technology within the project intended to extend the pot life to 2,200 days enabled increasing the life of stopped pots by 1.3 months
versus 2015.

Technology Stability

Due to the efficient system of production technology control and management, no significant technology failure occurred at UC RUSAL
smelters in 2016.

Alumina

The project of creating a technology for alumina production of non-bauxite high-silicon raw
materials was advanced to the next level. A
full-cycle refinery was created in miniature with
support of the grant received from the Moscow
Institute of Steel and Alloys and the Ministry of
Education. Consolidated researches are carried
out to select optimal process mode parameters
and prepare a mass and energy balance for
performing financial and economic evaluation
of the production facility construction.

To extend the ore base, AGK developed a technologically sound and economically expedient
solution for beneficiation of ores from the Goryachegorskoye Deposit. The quality of the concentrate produced allows involving it into processing using the existing technology of AGK.
Pre-design study was carried out with respect
to switching AGK to the new raw material base.
A license for subsoil use is being obtained.
Therefore, prospects were opened for extending the life cycle of Achinsk Alumina Refinery
by 50 years after exhaustion of the Kiya-Shaltyr Nepheline Ore Deposit (2028-2030).
A pilot site was created for Sc2O3 production
of red mud. The technology was fine-tuned
and 10 kg of scandium oxide with the purity
of 99.4% were produced. The quality of produced scandium oxide was confirmed by 3 independent laboratories. An additional advantage opportunity was tested arranging for dry
red mud storage in case of industrial implementation of the technology. The technology

The “Formula for the Future” program is focused on the work and development of the
youth councils at industrial sites of UC RUSAL.
The youth councils have been established and
developed at the enterprises of the Company
during the past six years. Their active participants were trained in social projects design,
presentation and building partnerships. In
2016, activists of the youth council held about
200 events for employees of enterprises, social institutions of cities where the Company
operates, veterans of production, students
and schoolchildren. Activists also received
17 grants for the development of its social projects
in the framework of competitions DSP RUSAL
“Helping is Easy” and “RUSAL Territory”. Youth
councils focused their projects on career guidance for children at risk, as well as creative
work with children in the supported social institutions. In 2016, the Youth Gathering was
held for 100 of the most active leaders of youth
councils, in which participants exchanged their
groups’ best practices and accomplishments
and exercized in strategic planning of sustainable growth of the Company in the next few
decades.

d. Social Enterpreneurship Development

In 2016, UC RUSAL continued to implement

 luminum premiums in key consuming
A
regions started to improve at the end
of 4Q16 with a 20% rise in OctoberDecember compared to the beginning of
this year. This was supported by strong
demand and reduced supply in key regions after smelting capacity reduction/
closures (NA, Australia).
The LME aluminium price reached USD1,934/t
in March 2017 and has remained stable around
USD1,900/t since mid-February-March. This
was attributable to a growing global metal
deficit (0.7 million tonnes) driven by the US,
EU and continued supply moderation in China
coupled with significant production cost inflation. Global manufacturing activity in the beginning of 2017 expanded to its highest level
since 2011 underpinning strong metal demand
for the rest of the year.

Aluminium demand

Global aluminium demand grew by 5.5% in
2016 to 59.7 million tonnes. Demand rose in the
world (excluding China) by 3.4% to 28.3 million
tonnes, while China’s growth alone increased
7.6% to 31.4 million tonnes.
China’s economy hit its growth target last
year accelerating towards the end of the year.
China’s economic growth remained stable in
3Q, ensuring the government achieved its fullyear growth target. Gross domestic product
expanded 6.7% in 2016 YoY, above the official
target of 6.5%. The China Caixin Manufacturing PMI rose to 51.9 in December from 50.9
in November, avoiding contractionary territory
for the sixth month straight.

47

China’s industrial output rose 6% YoY with retail sales increasing 10.9% in 2016. Fixed-asset
investment for the whole year grew 8.1% YoY.
China produced 28.19 million units of vehicles
in 2016, up 14.5% YoY, according to monthly
data released by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). Sales of commercial buildings rose 35% percent in 2016,
and residential sales climbed 36% for the same
period. As prices continued to increase in 2016,
this led to healthy property restocking and
growth in construction activity.
In North America, Donald Trump’s win in the
US Presidential elections saw a surge in economic optimism. His proposed infrastructure
spending plan increased most indicators by
the end of the year. The US manufacturing
sector ended 2016 on a buoyant note, with
promising signs of further growth in 2017. The
pace of growth signaled by the PMI in December (54.7) was at its strongest for almost two
years, driven almost entirely by rising demand
from domestic customers, with exports hindered by the dollar’s recent surge. Construction was relatively strong with the number of
new housing growing by nearly 5% in 2016
YoY. Automotive production increased by 1.2%
in North America.
The Eurozone manufacturing sector also ended 2016 on a high note; the PMI climbed up
to 54.9 in December. Alongside the improved
performance of the Eurozone manufacturing
sector, production and new orders witnessed
its fastest growth. Rates of expansion in both
were either at, or close to, the steepest increase since early 2011. Car production in Europe increased in 2016 on the back of EUR/
USD depreciation in 2H16, as well as increased
demand in exporting countries such as the US
and China, where demand is supported by tax
reduction for lower-powered light vehicles.
Preliminary data for the first eleven months of
2016 showed a rise by 3.7% YoY.

Growth in the ASEAN economy remained on
track with annual growth at 4.7% in 2016, a
slight pick-up from 4.5% in 2015. Car production growth gained momentum at the end of
2016, largely in Thailand (2.7%), Indonesia
(5.6%), and Vietnam (38.4%) where domestic
demand and exports uptick boosted manufacturing. According to preliminary data for the
January-November period, automotive production grew by 3% in the region.
In 2016, Russia’s key economic indicators
continued to decrease. According to preliminary data, the GDP index was -0.7%, industrial production index for processing industries
was -0.7%, and fixed assets investments decreased by -3.3%.
However, by the end of the year there were
signs of stabilization. Current forecasts for
2017 predict that indicators will be positive.
In the second half of 2016, PMI demonstrated
steady growth, peaking in November/December at 53.7, which is the highest it has been
for 69 months. Cheap ruble currency make
domestic producers more competitive for both
domestic and export markets. Passenger car
production continued to decline due to a lower
automotive market demand, but commercial
vehicles (trucks, light commercial vehicles,
buses) production increased by +8.2% in
2016 compared to 2015.
Against the backdrop of a weak ruble, in 2016
the volume of aluminium semis imports significantly decreased while exports increased.
As a result, the volume of exports of aluminum products exceeded imports for the first
time. That has allowed domestic enterprises to
retain production volume in terms of reducing
domestic demand.

The final months of 2016 saw Japan’s economy expand with exports rebounding meaningfully along with production backed by the
sharp depreciation of the yen and improving
global demand. The PMI posted 52.4 in December, up from 51.3 in November, signaling
a sharper improvement in manufacturing conditions in Japan and this contributed to the
strongest quarterly average since 4Q 2015. In
2016, Japanese new house building increased
by over 5% according to the latest data for the
January-November period.

Supply

Overall global aluminum supply rose by 3.6%
to 59 million tonnes in 2016 YoY.
IAI and CRU data show that during 2016, primary aluminium production in the world excluding
China rose 2.2% to 26.7 million tonnes mostly
due to growth in Asia, Malaysia and Eastern
Europe. According to the Aladdiny agency, aluminum production in China increased by 5.5%
to 32.3 million tonnes. This was a result of new
capacity ramping up in Q4 2016.
Despite 4 million tonnes of new Chinese capacity in 2016 and some restarted capacity, we
believe that the Chinese market will become
more balanced due to its adoption of the new
antipollution plan. In addition, the country may
still have a high risk of supply tightness due
to the new environmental measures against
pollution including outlined capacity closures
(below 300KA) and a significant decline in new
capacity additions. This is similar to what we
have witnessed and was implemented in the
steel sector.
The Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) is tightening control over pollution due to an increase in heavy smog during
December-January. Four provinces near Beijing 2+26 cities (namely, Hebei, Shandong,
Henan, Shanxi) occupy just 7% of the territory of China but produce 340 Mt of steel (43%
of China’s total), 47% of coke, 12 Mt of energy intensive aluminium (38%), 460 Mt of cement (19%) and 27% of coal-fired power. This
scale of pollution producing facilities within a
relatively small area creates enormous pressure on both the environment and on the civilian’s health. According to the new antipollution plan developed by the MEP with other
authorized bodies and approved by the Chinese
Government, 30% of approximately 10Mtpy of
aluminium smelting capacity in these provinces
is due to close between November to March

Creating value / Annual report 2016

in 2017-2018. This would result in a 1.2Mt impact in the first full year of the policy. It would
also make greenfield and brownfield expansions in these key producing provinces unlikely.
In addition, 30% of alumina and 50% of anode/
cathode production in 2+26 cities could potentially affect further key raw materials prices appreciation used for aluminum production. Since
January last year, the average weighted production cash cost for China’s aluminum industry climbed by 40% and according to February
2017 cash cost data and SHFE average price in
February (RMB13,800/t), there were 14% (or
5Mt) of loss making capacities in China based
on the estimation current cost curve which has
a strong support at RMB14,000/t level.

Aluminium Division

The Aluminium Division comprises the smelters located in Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk,
Sayanogorsk, Novokuznetsk, Kandalaksha,
Tayozhny, and Sundsvall (Sweden).

Aluminium production:

Production of alloys went up from 1.4 million tonnes in 2015 to 1.632 million tonnes in
2016, with the share of alloys increasing from
40% to 44% in 2016.
Development of the in-house technology
of primary aluminium production:
The implementation of the project to

improve a high-amperage pot design is
in progress at a pilot area at SAZ: sixteen RA-400 and RA-400Т pots and five
RA-500 pots are in operation;
The project to convert of С-2/3 Soderberg pots to the RА-167 pre-bake technology continues at NkAZ: 10 pots, a
gas treatment center and a feeding unit
are in operation and running at target
parameters. In September 2016, introduction of the new cathode design with
unshaped materials began, and a pilot
Green Soderberg area consisting of six
S8BMe pots was launched;
he refining of the Green Soderberg
T
technology continues at a pilot area at
BrAZ: in 2016, 45 pots were equipped
with an automatic raw materials feed
system and a centralised alumina distribution system; 19 pots received improved cathodes (S-8BA type) during
rebuilding. In total, the automatic raw
materials feed system was installed on
135 operational pots. As of the end of
2016, the smelter has 40 running S-8Ba
type pots;
The conversion of Potrooms 1-6, 9, and
11-23 to the Green Soderberg technology is on-going at KrAZ. As of the end
of 2016, the smelter has 971 improved
design pots, of which 298 pots were
converted in 2016.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

Energy efficiency:

Energy efficiency projects were successfully implemented at all smelters of the
Aluminium Division. Implementation of
energy efficiency actions in 2016 helped
reducing the specific consumption of
general plant electricity by 350 kWh/t
from 2013, when the projects were
launched;
As part of the anode slotting area construction project at SAZ, main activities
were completed; equipment commissioning and technology testing are in
progress;

 uccessful tests of energy efficient pot
S
designs were completed at pilot areas of
KrAZ, SAZ, KhAZ and IrkAZ for further
replication at other production facilities
of the Division. Introduction of energy
efficiency S-255 type pots began at SAZ
(where pots are replaced during rebuilding), and the successful OA-120 pot design is being further proliferated at KrAZ.

Increase in production of alloys:

At SAZ, a remelting furnace was com
missioned in 2016 to recycle off-cuts
from 1xxx, 5xxx, 6xxx and 8xxx alloys,
and technical grade aluminium. The capacity of the furnace is 20,281 tpa;
In 2016, a Properzi continuous horizontal casting line was installed at KhAZ
with the capacity of up to 120 ktpa of
10-kg bars. Commissioning of the new
line is in progress.

51

Use of new mechanical equipment in
potrooms:

In 2016, Russian Engineering Company
(REC) manufactured 25 pot treatment
machines, including a new machine
to clean the gas removal system and
a multi-purpose potroom machine. At
BrAZ, several projects were implemented to mechanize anode beam racking. An
important advantage of such projects is
that it creates a strong import substitution potential. RUSAL’s in-house designers not only design concepts for new
machinery but also continuously seek opportunities to use domestically produced
parts. The plan for 2017 is to manufacture and supply 34 new machines.

Alumina production results

UC RUSAL’s total attributable alumina output13
was 7,528 thousand tonnes in 2016 and 7,402
thousand tonnes in 2015. The increase of alumina output in 2016 by 126 thousand tonnes
(1.7%) was due to the more stable operation
of AGK, Windalco and QAL, as well as a result
of implementation of production capacity increase program at BAZ, UAZ, NGZ.
Calculated based on the pro rata share of the
Company’s (and its subsidiaries’) ownership in
corresponding alumina refineries.

Health, safety, environment (HSE):

roduction facilities of the Aluminium
P
Division confirmed compliance of their
respective HSE management systems
with OHSAS 18001 following an external
audit by DNV.

Silicon production

The output fell in 2016 due to scheduled repairs on the main production equipment.
Measures to improve the quality of silicon produced continued to be implemented in 2016 as
part of the program to ensure the aluminium
smelters of UC RUSAL get 100% of the silicon they need from the company’s own production facilities: refining is being expanded,
new stricter requirements for the quality of
raw materials were introduced, quartzite that
comes from the Company’s mines now undergoes additional processing, an in-house laboratory was set up at SUAL-Kremny-Ural. As a
result of all these measures, the share of clean
silicon grades in total output went up by 14%
at SUAL-Kremny-Ural and by 5% at Kremny.
Now the aluminium smelters are getting 97%
of the silicon they need from the company’s
own silicon production facilities.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

Powders

The output increased as a result of an increase
in sales of aluminium powders. The bulk of the
uptake in sales was achieved thanks to changes to the pricing policy in the markets of Germany and France as well as employing a more
focused approach to the quality of packaging
and ensuring timely delivery of powders. An
increase in sales of highly dispersed powders
to solar power generating companies was also
recorded. It should be noted that the quality of UC RUSAL’s powders allowed the Russian company Monocrystal to increase sales of
metallization pastes in all the key photovoltaic
markets. Despite the 10-12% contraction in
the domestic construction market in 2016 on
the 2015 level, UC RUSAL managed to expand
its sales of powders and pastes (specialized
gas forming agents) and expand the company’s share in the market to 81%. This growth
was achieved by a timely response to changes
in the market with regards to pricing and payment terms.

57

The New Projects Directorate is implementing
projects to retrofit the existing powder production capacity and expand the product range.
The projects aim to improve product quality
and expand the product range (specialized gas
forming agents based on RA, RC, RB cell concrete) as well as to expand the share of value
added products in the total output:
Production of pilot batches of special
ized gas forming agents started on new
grinding equipment at VgAZ SUAL;
 ass production started for a number

3D printing (additive production), pilot
batches of powders from high strength
aluminium alloys were produced;
A project is being implemented to pro
duce a new group of aluminium pigments
based on the utilizing the wet grinding
process. These will be intended for use
in the production of lacquers and paints.

increased by 1.6% to 17,525 kt in 2016, as
compared to 17,250 kt in 2015. The increase in
volume in 2016 as compared to 2015 was due
to increased sales of coal to Kazakh customers
resulting from increased regional demand.

Transportation results

Total coal and other goods carried by rail Bogatyr Trans LLC, attributable to a 50% share
of the company decreased by 4.7% to 6,237
thousand in 2016, compared to 6,542 thousand in 2015. The decline in 2016 compared
to 2015 was due to a decrease in the delivery
of coal in Russia, which was partially offset
by an increase in the transportation of coal in
Kazakhstan.

Sales of alumina

Revenue from sales of primary aluminium and
alloys decreased by USD665 million, or by
9.1%, to USD6,614 million in 2016, as compared to USD7,279 million in 2015, primarily
due to 13.4% decrease in the weighted-average realized aluminium price per tonne driven
by a decrease in the LME aluminium price (to
an average of USD1,604 per tonne in 2016
from USD1,663 per tonne in 2015), as well as
a decrease in premiums above the LME prices
60

in the different geographical segments (to an
average of USD159 per tonne from USD281
per tonne in 2016 and 2015, respectively).
Revenue from sales of alumina increased by
USD27 million or by 4.5% to USD622 million for the year ended 31 December 2016 as
compared to USD595 million for the previous
year. The increase was mostly attributable
to 31.6% growth in alumina sales volume
Creating value / Annual report 2016

partially offset by a 20.8% decrease in the
average sales price.
Revenue from sales of foil decreased by 11.1%
to USD240 million in 2016, as compared to
USD270 million in 2015, primarily due to a
6.5% decrease in the weighted average sales
price and 4.9% decrease in sales volumes.
Revenue from other sales, including sales of
other products, bauxite and energy services

decreased by 5.4% to USD507 million for the
year ended 31 December 2016 as compared
to USD536 million for the previous year, due
to a 22.0% decrease in sales of other materials (such as silicon by 16.2%, soda by 12.2%,
potassium sulfate by 48.9%).

Total cost of sales decreased by USD145 million, or by 2.3%, to USD6,070 million in 2016,
as compared to USD6,215 million in 2015. The
decrease was primarily driven by the continuing depreciation of the Russian Ruble and the
Ukrainian Hryvnia against the US Dollar by
10.0% and 17.0%, respectively, between the
reporting periods which was partially offset by
the increase in volumes of primary aluminium
and alloys sold.
Cost of alumina decreased in the reporting
period (as compared to 2015) by USD17 million, or by 2.3%, primarily as a result of a
decrease in alumina transportation costs following significant Russian Ruble depreciation
and a slight decrease in tariff.
Cost of bauxite decreased by 20.6% for the
year ended 31 December 2016 as compared
to the same period of prior year, primarily as
a result of a decrease in the purchase price.
Cost of raw materials (other than alumina
and bauxite) and other costs decreased by
2.6% due to the lower raw materials purchase
price in 2016 as compared to the previous
year (such as raw petroleum coke by 30.0%,
calcined petroleum coke by 20.9%, pitch by
6.2%, raw pitch coke by 2.5%).

Energy cost decreased in 2016 by 6.7% to
USD1,568 million compared to USD1,680 million in 2015 primarily due to the continuing
depreciation of the Russian Ruble against the
US Dollar and 5.5% decrease in the average
electricity tariff.

Distribution, administrative and other
expenses

Distribution expenses decreased by 1.5% to
USD331 million in 2016, compared to USD336
million in 2015, primarily due to the decrease
in transportation tariffs as well as the continuing depreciation of the Russian Ruble against
the US Dollar between the periods.
Administrative expenses, which include personnel costs, decreased by 2.3% to USD521
million in 2016, compared to USD533 million
in 2015 and primarily resulted from the depreciation of the Russian Ruble to the US Dollar
within the comparable periods.

Gross profit

As a result of the foregoing factors, UC RUSAL
reported a gross profit of USD1,913 million for
the year ended 31 December 2016 as compared to USD2,465 million for the previous
period, representing gross margins of the periods of 24.0% and 28.4%, respectively.

Increase in purchases of primary aluminium
and alloys were mainly caused by start of aluminium production at BoAZ and further increase of its production capacity. The Group
purchases aluminium from BoAZ under longterm purchase commitment for further export.

Finance income decreased by USD4 million to
USD19 million in 2016 as compared to USD23
million in 2015, due to the decrease in the interest income on time deposit at several subsidiaries of the Group.
Financial expenses decreased by 22.3%
to USD879 million in 2016 as compared to
USD1,132 million in 2015 primarily due to a
decrease in interest expenses, the foreign exchange loss and the net loss from the change
in fair value of derivative financial instruments,
slightly offset by an increase in bank charges.
Interest expenses on bank and company
loans in 2016 decreased by USD17 million to
USD610 million from USD627 million in 2015
due to the reduction of the principal amount
payable to international and Russian lenders

and the decrease of the overall interest margin between the periods.
The decrease of the net foreign exchange loss
to USD105 million in 2016 from USD140 million for the same period of 2015 was driven
by the revaluation of working capital items of
several Group companies denominated in foreign currencies.
The net loss from the change in fair value of
derivative financial instruments decreased to
USD157 million for the years ended 31 December 2016 from USD352 million for the
same period of 2015 as a result of the Russian
Ruble’s fluctuations which led to the revaluation of certain cross-currency instruments.

The Company’s share in profits of associates
for the years ended 31 December 2016 and
2015 comprised USD688 million and USD193
million, respectively. Share in results of associates in both periods resulted primarily from
the profit from the Company’s investment in
Norilsk Nickel, which amounted to USD688
million and USD486 million for 2016 and 2015,
respectively, due to the better performance of
Norilsk Nickel between periods.
The market value of the investment in Norilsk
Nickel at 31 December 2016 was USD7,348
million as compared to USD5,542 million as at
31 December 2015.
Share of profits of joint ventures was USD160
million for the year ended 31 December 2016
as compared to USD175 million for the same
period in 2015. This represents the Company’s share of profits in joint ventures, namely
BEMO, LLP Bogatyr Komir, Mega Business and

Profit before income tax

UC RUSAL earned a profit before income tax
in an amount of USD1,354 million for the
year ended 31 December 2016, as compared
to a profit before income tax in an amount of
USD763 million for the year ended 31 December 2015 due to reasons set out above.

Income tax

Income tax expense decreased by USD30 million to USD175 million in 2016, as compared
to USD205 million in 2015.
Current tax expenses decreased by USD51
million, or 29.5%, to USD122 million for the
year ended 31 December 2016, as compared
to USD173 million for the previous year primarily due to the reduction withholding tax on
dividends received from Norilsk Nickel.
Deferred tax increased by USD21 million, or
65.6%, to USD53 million for the year ended
31 December 2016, as compared to USD32
million for the previous year primarily due to
reversal of impairment non-current assets of
several subsidiaries.

Profit for the period

As a result of the above, the Company recorded a profit of USD1,179 million in 2016, as
compared to USD558 million in 2015.

Assets and liabilities

UC RUSAL’s total assets increased by USD1,643
million, or 12.8% to USD14,452 million as at
31 December 2016 as compared to USD12,809
million as at 31 December 2015. The increase
in total assets is mainly resulted from the increase in the carrying value of the investment
in Norilsk Nickel.
Total liabilities decreased by USD265 million,
or 2.3%, to USD11,153 million as at 31 December 2016 as compared to USD11,418 million as at 31 December 2015. The decrease
was mainly due to the decrease in the Company’s provisions and financial liabilities.

Cash flows

Net cash generated from the investing activities for 2016 decreased to USD104 million as compared to USD261 million for 2015
primarily due to a decrease in dividends received from associates and joint ventures in
amount USD336 million for 2016 as compared
to USD755 million for the prior year.
The above mentioned factors allowed the Company to assign USD143 million of its own cash
flows for the debt repayment that together
with the interest payments of USD452 million,
dividends paid in amount of USD250 million
and settlement of derivative financial instruments of USD446 million represent the main
components of the cash used in the financing
activities with the total amount of USD1,305
million for 2016.

Business risks

In order to reduce the negative effects of potential dangers and to ensure stable and sustainable business development, the Company
pays particular attention to building an effective risk management system.
Risk management is a part of the competence
of the risk management group created by the
Board as a part of the Directorate for Control.
The main internal documents governing activity in this area are:
 he Risk Management Policy, which deT
termines the general concept and employee obligations in the risk management process;

Creating value / Annual report 2016

 he Regulations on Risk Management,
T
which organise the risk management
process and include a description of the
key tools and methods for identifying,
assessing and mitigating risks.
The key elements of the Company’s risk management system are: defining and assessing
risks, developing and implementing risk mitigation measures, risk management reporting, and assessing the performance of the risk
management system.

Key steps taken in risk management

 rganising independent risk audits at
O
Company enterprises conducted by specialists of the Willis Group and the Ingosstrakh Engineering Center to reduce
risks and optimise the Company’s insurance program;
 reparation of an annual Corporate Risk
P
Map by the Directorate for Control and
its quarterly updating;
Performance of risk management sys
tem reviews and audits by the Directorate for Control;
Preparation of the UC RUSAL risk insurance programs.

83

Monitoring, reporting and performance
assessment of the risk management
system

The Directorate for Control regularly reports
on its activities to the Board and Audit Committee. As part of these reports, the Directorate for Control provides information on the
risk management system, the results of preparing risk maps, new risks, and the mitigation of various types of risks.
The Audit Committee oversees how well management monitors compliance with the Company’s risk management policies and procedures. Based on the reporting submitted, the
Audit Committee and the Board review the
Company’s risk profile and the results of its
risk management programs on a quarterly and
annual basis respectively.
In 2016, the Company has identified the following risks which affect its business:
1.

2.

3.

4.

84

5.

The Group benefits significantly from its
low effective tax rate, and changes to the
Group’s tax position may increase the
Group’s tax liability and affect its cost
structure.

6.

The Group is exposed to foreign currency
fluctuations which may affect its financial
results.

7.

En+ is able to influence the outcome
of important decisions relating to the
Group’s business, which includes transactions with certain related parties.

8.

The Group depends on the services of key
senior management personnel and the
strategic guidance of Mr. Oleg Deripaska.

9.

Adverse media speculation, claims and
other public statements could adversely
affect the value of the Shares.

The Group operates in a cyclical industry that has recently experienced price
and demand volatility, which has had and
may continue to have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s performance and financial results.

10. The Group’s business may be affected by
labor disruptions, shortages of skilled labor and labor cost inflation.

The Group’s competitive position in the
global aluminium industry is highly dependent on continued access to inexpensive and uninterrupted electricity supply,
in particular, long-term contracts for such
electricity. Increased electricity prices
(particularly as a result of deregulation of
electricity tariffs), as well as interruptions
in the supply of electricity, could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results
of operations.

12. Equipment failures or other difficulties
may result in production curtailments or
shutdowns.

The Group depends on the provision of
uninterrupted transportation services and
access to state-owned infrastructure for
the transportation of its materials and
end products across significant distances,
and the prices for such services (particularly rail tariffs) could increase.
The terms of the credit facility agreements
impose certain limits on the Group’s capital expenditure and payment of dividends.
Failure by the Group to comply with the
terms and conditions of these agreements
may materially adversely affect the Group
and its Shareholders.

11. The Group relies on third-party suppliers
for certain materials.

13. The Group is subject to certain requirements under Russian anti-monopoly laws.
14. The Group operates in an industry that
gives rise to health, safety and environmental risks.
15. Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources data
are estimates only and are inherently uncertain, and such Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources may be depleted more
rapidly than anticipated.
16. The Group’s licenses and concession rights
to explore and mine Ore Reserves may be
suspended, amended or terminated prior
to the end of their terms or may not be
renewed.
17. The Group is exposed to risks relating to
the multi-jurisdictional regulatory, social,
legal, tax and political environment in
which the Group operates.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

The net effect of the risks in the year 2016
mentioned above was positive for the Company due to the influence of high LME prices
exceeding influence of negative risk outcomes
such as ruble appreciation and decrease of
premiums. It is important to note that gross
effect of negative risk outcomes was lower
than the influence of LME prices due to the efficient risk management techniques applied by
the Company in accordance with the Regulation on Risk Management that was significantly
updated in the year 2016. Thus, the ongoing
development of risk management techniques
applied to increase shareholders wealth is one
of the core goals of the Company.

Contingencies

The Board has reviewed and considered the
contingent liabilities of the Company and disclosed information concerning such contingent

Tax contingencies

New transfer pricing legislation was introduced in Russia from 1 January 2012 which
applies to cross-border transactions between
the Group companies in and out of Russia and
to certain domestic related parties’ transactions in Russia exceeding a certain annual
threshold (RUB1 billion from 2014). The new
legislation brings local transfer pricing rules
closer to the OECD guidelines, however creates additional immediate uncertainty in their
application and interpretation. Since there is
no practice of applying the new rules by the
Russian tax authorities and the pre-existing
practice and case-law is of little reliance, it
is difficult to predict the effect, if any, of the
new transfer pricing rules on the consolidated
financial statements. The Company nevertheless believes it is compliant with the new rules
as it has historically applied the OECD-based
transfer pricing principles to the relevant
transactions in Russia.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

The new controlled foreign company (“CFC”)
rules have been introduced in Russia starting
from 1 January 2015. The rules apply to undistributed profits of non-Russian CFC controlled
by Russian tax-resident shareholders. The
Company is tax-resident in Cyprus and managed and controlled from Cyprus and the new
CFC rules shall not directly apply to the Group in
relation to any of its non-Russian affiliates. The
CFC rules may apply to a Russian tax-resident
controlling shareholder of the Company, where
such shareholder controls more than 50% of
the Company (starting from 2016, more than
25% of the Company or 10% where all Russian tax-resident shareholders together control
more than 50% of the Company). The rules
also introduce certain reporting requirements
for such Russian tax-resident controlling shareholders of the Company starting from 2015 in
relation to non-Russian affiliates of the Group
where such shareholders directly or indirectly
control more than 10% of those affiliates.

Legal contingencies

The Group’s business activities expose it to a
variety of lawsuits and claims which are monitored, assessed and contested on an ongoing basis. Where management believes that a
lawsuit or claim would result in the outflow of
the economic benefits for the Group, a best
estimate of such outflow is included in provisions in the consolidated financial statements
(refer to note 24(c) of the consolidated financial statements). As at 31 December 2016, the
amount of claims, where management assess
outflows as possible approximate USD60 million (31 December 2015: USD37 million).
In January 2013, the Company received a writ
of summons and statement of claim filed in
the High Court of Justice of the Federal Capital
Territory of Nigeria (Abuja) by plaintiff BFIG
Group Divino Corporation (“BFIG”) against
certain subsidiaries of the Company. It is a
claim for damages arising out of the defendants’ alleged tortious interference in the bid
process for the sale of the Nigerian government’s majority stake in the ALSCON and alleged loss of BFIG’s earnings resulting from its
failed bid for the said stake in ALSCON. BFIG
seeks compensatory damages in the amount
of USD2.8 billion plus interest. The Company
does not expect the case to have any material
adverse effect on the Group’s financial position or its operation as a whole. The Company
has filed its statement of defense and witness
statements in support of its legal position. The
next hearing is scheduled for 22 May 2017.

Other than as disclosed, as at 31 December

SFO) which were notified to the Company or
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and entered
into the register required to be kept under
section 352 of the SFO, or which were notified
to the Company and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange pursuant to the Model Code.

In considering whether the Board and senior
management of the Company are independent
from the senior management of each of En+,
SUAL Partners and Glencore, the Directors
have taken into account the following general
reasons, as well as the specific reasons applicable to each of En+, SUAL Partners and
Glencore:

16 Directors’ interests in businesses
that may compete with the Company

(b) the decision-making mechanism of the
Board set out in the Articles of Association provides that all Directors with a conflicting interest shall not vote when a conflicted resolution is to be discussed and
voted on;

Mr. Deripaska, Ms. Gulzhan Moldazhanova,
Mr. Maxim Sokov and Ms. Olga Mashkovskaya
were interested in/were directors of En+, Mr.
Len Blavatnik (ceased to be a non-executive
Director on 10 November 2016) was interested in SUAL Partners, Mr. Ivan Glasenberg was
interested in Glencore and was a director and
the Chief Executive Officer of Glencore. En+,
SUAL Partners and Glencore are businesses
which compete or are likely to compete, either directly or indirectly, with the Company.
The summary below provides a description of
these businesses, as well as facts demonstrating that UC RUSAL is capable of carrying on its
own business independently of and at arm’s
length from these businesses.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

(a) the Board consists of eighteen Directors,
comprising three executive Directors,
nine non-executive Directors and six independent non-executive Directors;

(c) the Board has six independent non-executive Directors with extensive corporate
governance and financial experience and
is able to review, enhance and implement
measures to manage any conflict of interests between the businesses in which the
Directors have interests and the Group
in order to protect minority shareholders’ interests and to manage the affairs
of the Group independently of the businesses in which the Directors have interests that may compete with the Company.

167

The independent non-executive Directors
make recommendations on proposed connected transactions by the Company. A
committee of the independent non-executive Directors will make recommendations
to the independent shareholders on how
to vote for any resolution that relates to
future connected transactions pursuant to
the Listing Rules’ requirements;
(d) all connected transactions which are subject to reporting and announcement requirements under the Listing Rules have
to be reviewed by the Audit Committee
before they are approved by the Board.
In respect of each specific relevant business:

A. En+

En+ is a limited liability company incorporated
under the laws of Jersey with its registered office at 44 Esplanade St. Helier, JE4 9WG, Channel Islands. En+ is ultimately controlled by one
of its beneficial owners Mr. Deripaska, who indirectly holds 91.65% of the shares in En+.
En+’s strategy is to focus on businesses with
mining expertize, including in relation to the
extraction of raw materials for energy production, electricity generation and the production
of non-ferrous metals. En+ specializes in metals that require high energy consumption and
then looks for synergies between its energy
producing and energy consuming businesses.
Key assets of En+ include:
EuroSibEnergo – a wholly-owned power company with core generating assets located in
Siberia, Russia. EuroSibEnergo has in total installed capacity of 19.5 GW, out of which 15.1
GW accounts for hydro power plants, three of
which are among top-20 hydro power plants
in the world in terms of installed capacity. It
manages assets in power generation, power
trading and supply and engineering services,
as well as power transmission and distribution.
UC RUSAL – one of the largest producers of
aluminium and alumina in the world with fully
integrated value chain from bauxite mining to
primary aluminium production. Core aluminium producing facilities are located in Siberia enjoying access to clean environmentally

168

friendly hydro power. UC RUSAL is one of the
lowest cost producers globally, benefiting from
cheap, clean and renewable hydro energy in
Siberia.
Other assets are complementary to the key
businesses and include coal and logistics operations that primarily support power operations, as well as KraMZ (aluminium metallurgical plant) and SMR (molybdenum and
ferromolybdenum producer).
Independence from En+
Having considered all relevant factors, including the following, the Directors are satisfied
that the Group can conduct its business independently of En+:

Independence of the Board and the
Group’s Senior Management from the Senior Management of En+
The majority of the Board currently comprises
of non-executive Directors due to a historical
arrangement between En+, SUAL Partners,
Glencore and Onexim, pursuant to which they
are each entitled to nominate a certain number of candidates for appointment as Directors. As at the Latest Practicable Date, nine of
the Directors were nominated by En+, four of
which Directors are also directors of En+. The
overlapping Directors at the Latest Practicable
Date were Mr. Deripaska (being executive Director) and Mr. Sokov, Ms. Mashkovskaya and
Ms. Moldazhanova (being non-executive Directors). All of the overlapping Directors have
been elected on the basis of their qualifications and breadth of experience, as set out
in further details in the “Profiles of Directors
and Senior Management” section in this Annual Report. The Company’s non-executive
Directors attend Board meetings and provide
guidance to and decide on the Company’s important matters. Certain of the non-executive
Directors also sit on the committees of the
Board and are responsible for the matters related to such committees.
For the general reasons stated above, the Directors are of the view that the Group is able
to operate independently from En+, notwithstanding the fact that nine Directors are nominated by En+.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

Based on the above, the Board is satisfied that
the Board as a whole, together with our senior
management team, are able to perform their
managerial role in the Group independently.

Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its
businesses, and operates as a business group
which is separate from and fully independent
of En+.
The Group has, as disclosed under the section
entitled “Connected Transactions” of this Annual Report, entered into contracts with companies controlled by Mr. Deripaska for the purchase of electricity, and may continue to do so
in the future.
As aluminium production is energy intensive,
access to relatively inexpensive Siberian hydropower is central to the competitive strategy of the Group. However, notwithstanding
the volume of such purchases from companies
owned and controlled by Mr. Deripaska and
the importance of electricity costs to the production activities of the Group, the Company
does not consider that it is, as a consequence,
overly reliant on Mr. Deripaska for the following reasons:
(a) the Group has access to alternative sources of electricity as the Group’s Russian
smelters are connected to the Russian
power grid, meaning that electricity supplies can be obtained from various power
plants, all of which are also connected to
the grid. These supplies are available to
the Group at market prices;
(b) the Group purchases electricity in accordance with the Rules of the Wholesale
Electricity and Capacity Market at contract
prices in accordance with direct sale-purchase agreements with suppliers (both
related or unrelated to the Controlling
Shareholder) and/or at market prices for
electricity sold on the market irrelative to
the particular supplier. In 2016, the overall share of electricity purchased by the
Group’s aluminium plants from the suppliers related to the Controlling Shareholder
did not exceed 44%. The Group has an
option of switching to suppliers unrelated
to the Controlling Shareholder including

Creating value / Annual report 2016

by purchasing electricity on the wholesale
electricity market, though there would be
certain price impact;
(c) none of the contracts is in take-or-pay
format;
(d) the Group is currently already a very
large volume user with significant negotiating power in the Russian power market.
In 2016, the Group has consumed approximately 28% of the power generated
in Siberia;
(e) the power plants owned or controlled by
Mr. Deripaska are located in remote regions where there is a limited number of
large volume users located in proximity to
such plants. Sales to distant users would
involve significant transmission losses
and, because Siberia is a surplus energy
producer, the result is that these plants
are more reliant on the customer rather
than vice versa.

Financial Independence
The Group’s financial auditing system is independent from En+ and employs a sufficient
number of dedicated financial accounting personnel responsible for financial auditing of the
Group’s accounts. The Company has independent bank accounts and independent tax registration. The Group’s treasury operations are
handled by the Company’s treasury department, whose functions include financing, treasury and cash managements and which operates independently from En+ and shares no
functions or resources with En+. The Group’s
choice of financial institutions is mainly based
on the credit standing of the institutions and
the terms offered by them. As at the year end
of 2016, En+ had not provided any security
and/or guarantee over the Group’s borrowings. As a result of the above analysis, the Directors believe that the Group is able to maintain financial independence from En+.
Extent of Competition
The only En+ businesses which compete with
or are likely to compete with the Group’s business, either directly or indirectly, are those
excluded businesses described below. However, by reason of the nature of such excluded

169

businesses and the clear delineation between
the Group’s business and such excluded businesses, the Group is fully capable of carrying on its businesses independently of and at
arm’s length from such excluded businesses.
There is no real competitive threat to the
Group’s businesses from the excluded businesses and there is no intention of the Company to acquire such excluded businesses.
CEAC’s main asset was KAP, an aluminum
smelter located in Podgorica, Montenegro.
KAP was declared bankrupt in October 2013.
All production assets of KAP (including the
smelter) were sold to a Montenegrin company
Uniprom. Therefore, CEAC is currently not involved in any aluminum or bauxite business
and may not be regarded as a competitor of
UC RUSAL.
Mr. Deripaska is a beneficial owner of En+, the
substantial shareholder of the KraMZ group of
companies. Most of the KraMZ plant’s raw materials (principally aluminium) are purchased
from companies within the Group (primarily
KrAZ). KraMZ’s main customers are industrial
customers located within Russia and abroad
that purchase aluminium rods, profiles, tubes
and cast aluminium alloys.
In addition, Mr. Deripaska was a beneficial
owner of En+, the substantial shareholder of
DOZAKL (until 11 March 2016), one of Russia’s manufacturers of aluminium composite
tape. It manufactures composite aluminium
tape (Lamister, Alumopolyethylene), anodized
sheet and strip for composite panels, strip for
soft food cans and aluminium strips for lamplight reflectors and lath ceilings in Russia and
the CIS. DOZAKL purchases most of its raw
materials (principally aluminium coil) from the
Group’s foil mills and on market. DOZAKL’s
main customers are industrial customers located within Russia and the CIS.

B. SUAL Partners

SUAL Partners is a limited liability company
incorporated under the laws of the Bahamas
whose registered office is at 2nd Terrace West,
Centreville, Nassau, Commonwealth of the Bahamas. SUAL Partners is beneficially owned by
a number of individuals, with Mr. Len Blavatnik
(who ceased to be a non-executive Director

170

on 10 November 2016) being a shareholder
of SUAL Partners as to more than 30% of
the total issued share capital. SUAL Partners
is a holding company that holds interests in
the Company and a separate kitchenware and
houseware business.
The Group has, as disclosed under the section entitled “Connected Transactions” of this
Annual Report, entered into contracts with
companies controlled by SUAL Partners for
aluminium sales, and may continue to do so
in the future. These aluminium sales contracts
have been entered into as part of the ordinary
course of business and pursuant to anti-monopoly requirements to supply aluminium to
Russian producers.
Independence from SUAL Partners
Having considered all relevant factors, including the following, the Group is satisfied that
it can conduct its business independently of
SUAL Partners:

Independence of the Board and the
Group’s Senior Management from the Senior Management of SUAL Partners
For the general reasons stated above, the Directors are of the view that the Group is able
to operate independently from SUAL Partners
because the Group’s day-to-day operations are
managed by three executive Directors who are
independent of and not connected with SUAL
Partners and the senior management team,
who are all independent of and not connected
with SUAL Partners.
Based on the above, the Board is satisfied that
the Board as a whole, together with the senior
management team, are able to perform their
managerial role in the Group independently.

Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its
businesses, and operates as a business group
which is separate from and fully independent
of SUAL Partners.
Financial Independence
The Group’s financial auditing system is independent from SUAL Partners and employs
a sufficient number of dedicated financial accounting personnel responsible for financial
auditing of the Group’s accounts. The Company has independent bank accounts and independent tax registration.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

The Group’s treasury operations are handled by the Company’s treasury department,
whose functions include financing, treasury
and cash management and which operates independently from SUAL Partners and shares
no functions or resources with SUAL Partners.
The Group’s choice of financial institutions is
mainly based on the credit standing of the institutions and the terms offered by them.
As at the year end of 2016, SUAL Partners had
not provided any security and/or guarantee
over the Group’s borrowings.
As a result of the above analysis, the Directors
believe that the Group is financially independent from SUAL Partners.

Extent of Competition
The Board is of the opinion that SUAL Partners
is not a competitor of the Company.

C. Glencore

Amokenga Holdings is a company incorporated in Bermuda whose registered office is
at 22 Victoria Street, Canon’s Court, Hamilton, HM12, Bermuda. Amokenga Holdings is
ultimately controlled by Glencore, which is a
public company listed on the London Stock Exchange, with secondary listings on the Hong
Kong and Johannesburg Stock Exchanges. No
individual shareholder controls more than 20%
of the share capital of Glencore. Glencore’s industrial and marketing activities are supported by a global network of more than 90 offices located in over 50 countries and employ
around 150,000 people, including contractors.
Mr. Glasenberg is a shareholder, director and
chief executive officer of Glencore, whose
principal business is the production and trading of commodities including aluminium. Mr.
Glasenberg is a non-executive Director of the
Company and is also a member of the corporate governance and nominations committee,
the standing committee and the Norilsk Nickel
investment supervisory committee. As he is
not an executive Director, he does not participate in the day-to-day management of the
Company, and accordingly is not involved in
the daily operations of the aluminium trading
division and so does not have access to confidential contracts entered into by that division.
Notwithstanding that his role on the Board
as a non-executive Director does not require
his involvement in the day-to-day management of the Company, this does not preclude

Creating value / Annual report 2016

Mr. Glasenberg from fulfilling his fiduciary duties. In case Mr. Glasenberg has a conflicting
interest, pursuant to the Articles of Association
of the Company, he shall abstain from voting
at Board meetings when a conflicted resolution is to be discussed and voted on, subject
to certain exceptions.
When the Group acquired certain of the alumina businesses of Glencore in late March 2007,
it became subject to a contract for the supply
of alumina to Glencore that continued through
2008, in declining amounts. The Group sold to
Glencore approximately 29.86% of its excess
alumina in monetary terms in 2016. The Company also has long term supply contracts with
Glencore for alumina and primary aluminium,
and Glencore was the Group’s largest customer of alumina and primary aluminium in the
financial year, accounting for approximately
35.11% of these interests were directly or
beneficially held by En+.
Independence from Glencore
Having considered all relevant factors, including the following, the Group is satisfied that
it can conduct its business independently of
Glencore:

Independence of the Board and the
Group’s Senior Management from the Senior Management of Glencore
For the general reasons stated above, the Directors are of the view that the Group is able to
operate independently from Glencore notwithstanding that one Director is also a director of
Glencore because the Group’s day-to-day operations are managed by three executive Directors and the senior management team who
are independent of and not connected with
Glencore.
Based on the above, the Board is satisfied that
the Board as a whole, together with the senior
management team, are able to perform their
managerial role in the Group independently.

Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its
businesses, and operates as a business group
which is separate from and fully independent
of Glencore.
Financial Independence
The Group’s financial auditing system is independent from Glencore and employs a sufficient number of dedicated financial accounting

171

personnel responsible for financial auditing of
the Group’s accounts. The Company has independent bank accounts and independent tax
registration.
The Group’s treasury operations are handled
by the Company’s treasury department, whose
functions include financing, treasury and cash
management and which operates independently from Glencore and shares no functions
or resources with Glencore.

17 Substantial Shareholders’ Interests

As at 31 December 2016, so far as the Directors are aware, the following interests or short
positions in the Shares or underlying Shares
of the Company were notified to the Company
pursuant to the provisions of Divisions 2 and 3
of Part XV of the SFO and were entered in the
register required to be kept by the Company
under section 336 of the SFO and of article
L.233-7 of the French Commercial Code:

The Group’s choice of financial institutions is
mainly based on the credit standing of the institutions and the terms offered by them.
As at the year end of 2016, Glencore had not
provided any security and/or guarantee over
the Group’s borrowings. As a result of the above
analysis, the Directors believe that the Group is
financially independent from Glencore.

Extent of Competition
Glencore participates in the marketing of both
aluminium and alumina from world markets
as well as from industrial assets in which it
has an interest. Glencore’s subsidiaries own
100% of the Columbia Falls aluminium smelter
(which is currently idle), 100% of the Sherwin
Alumina Refinery and has an economic interest of 47.5%16 in Century Aluminium Company, a NASDAQ-quoted company whose assets
include: the Ravenswood aluminium smelter
(which is currently idle), the Hawesville aluminium smelter and the Nordural aluminium
smelter and a 49.67% equity interest in the
Mt. Holly aluminium smelter. Glencore, in its
business of trading, is also a customer of the
Group.

Represents Glencore’s economic interest,
comprising 42.9 per cent voting interest and
4.6 per cent non-voting interest.

D. LTIP and the Production System
Incentive Plan (the “PSIP”)

On 11 May 2011, the Board adopted the LTIP,
in which eligible participants (being employees of the Group) were entitled to participate.
No new shares of the Company were issued for
the purposes of the LTIP.
Since all remaining shares which had been
granted under the LTIP vested in eligible participants in 2015, the plan terminated in 2015.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

In June 2013, the Board established the
PSIP, an employee share award plan aimed
at rewarding the Company’s employees for
achievements in the Production System implementation.
No new shares of the Company were issued for
the purposes of the PSIP. The maximum number of shares awarded under the PSIP did not
exceed 0.05% of the total number of issued
shares as at the date of the Award.
Since all remaining shares which had been
granted under the PSIP vested in eligible participants in 2015, the plan terminated in 2015.
Neither LTIP nor the PSIP constituted a share
option scheme or an arrangement analogous
to a share option scheme for the purpose of
Chapter 17 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of
Hong Kong Limited.

20 Pension schemes

Information on the Group’s pension schemes
is set out in Note 20(a) to the consolidated
financial statements.

21 Sufficiency of public float

The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has granted
the Company a waiver from strict compliance with Rule 8.08(1) (a) of the Listing Rules
to accept a lower public float percentage of
the Company of the higher of: (i) 10% of
the Shares, and (ii) the percentage of public
shareholding that equals HK$6 billion at the
Listing Date, as the minimum percentage of
public float of the Company. From the information publicly available to the Company and
within the knowledge of the Directors as at the
date of this Annual Report, the Company has
sufficiently maintained the abovementioned
public float.

22 Auditors

The consolidated financial statements have
been audited by JSC KPMG as the sole auditor who, having served for the whole of the
financial year, retire and, being eligible, offered themselves for re-appointment as the
Company’s sole auditor. A resolution for the
re-appointment of JSC KPMG as the sole auditor of the Company is to be proposed at the
forthcoming annual general meeting of the
Company.

177

23 Amendments to the constitution

The Articles of Association provides that the
Memorandum and the Articles of Association
are only capable of being amended by passing
of a special resolution. A special resolution is
defined in the Articles of Association as a resolution of the Company passed by a majority of
not less than three quarters of members who
(being entitled to do so) vote in person, or by
proxy, at a general meeting of the Company
of which not less than twenty-one clear days’
notice, specifying the intention to propose the
special resolution, has been given. Provided
that, if it is so agreed by a majority in number
of the members having the right to attend and
vote at such meeting upon the resolution, being a majority together holding not less than
ninety-five per cent of the total voting rights
of the members who have that right, a resolution may be proposed and passed as a special resolution at a meeting at which less than
twenty-one clear days’ notice has been given
in accordance with the Jersey Companies Law.

24 Litigation

Details of the litigation in which the Company,
its subsidiaries and certain beneficial owners are involved in are set out in notes 20(c)
(provisions for legal claims) and 24(c) (legal
contingencies) to the consolidated financial

25 Social investments and charity

Contribution to the socio-economic development of the countries and regions in which UC
RUSAL operates is a priority for the Company.
Being a leading global aluminium producer,
UC RUSAL is also one of the most active local
community investors with rich experience in
the development and implementation of widely outreaching social programs. RUSAL actively cooperates with regional governments,
nonprofits and other businesses at implementation of social programs, shares its social
investing experience with local communities
and supports their social initiatives. In 2016,
UC RUSAL allocated more than USD13.8 million to sponsorship and charity projects.

Corporate
Governance
Report
1. Corporate governance practices

The Company adopts international standards
of corporate governance. The Directors believe
that high quality corporate governance leads to
successful business development and increases
the investment potential of the Company, providing more security for shareholders, partners
and customers as well as reinforcing the Company’s internal control systems.
By working with international institutions such
as the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and the International Finance
Corporation, the Company developed and
implemented its corporate governance standards, based on the principles of transparent
and responsible business operations.
The Company adopted a corporate code of ethics on 7 February 2005. Based on recommendations of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International
Finance Corporation, the Company further
amended the corporate code of ethics in July
2007. The corporate code of ethics sets out
the Company’s values and principles for many
of its areas of operations.
The Directors adopted a corporate governance
code which is based on the CG Code in a Board
meeting on 11 November 2010. The Directors
believe that the Company has complied with
the provisions of the CG Code during the Review Period, other than as described in paragraphs 3(b) and 3(i) of this Corporate Governance Report.

The Directors are committed to upholding the
corporate governance of the Company to ensure that formal and transparent procedures
are in place to protect and maximize the interests of the shareholders.
Set out below is a detailed discussion of the
corporate governance practices adopted and
observed by the Company during the Review
Period.

2. Directors’ securities transactions

The Company has adopted a Code for Securities Transactions by Directors of the Company. The Code for Securities Transactions was
based on the Model Code as set out in Appendix 10 to the Listing Rules but it was made
more exacting than the required standard set
out in Appendix 10. It was also based on the
provisions of the French Monetary and Financial Code, the General Regulation of the AMF
and the EU Market Abuse Regulation, where
applicable. Having made specific enquiry of
all Directors, all Directors confirmed that they
had fully complied with the required standard
set out in the Model Code and the Code for
Securities Transactions throughout the Review
Period.
The Company has not been notified of any
other transaction by the Directors in application of the aforementioned provisions.

Biographical details of the Directors are set
out in the section headed Profiles of Directors
and Senior Management on pages 87 to 105 of
this Annual Report.

(b) Term of appointment of Directors

Paragraph A.4.1 of the CG Code provides that
non-executive Directors should be appointed
for a specific term, subject to re-election.
Paragraph A.4.2 of the CG Code provides that
every Director, including those appointed for a
specific term, should be subject to retirement
by rotation at least every three years. Each
of the non-executive Directors signed an appointment letter with the Company providing
for the same three years term. Article 24.2 of
the Articles of Association provides that if any
Director has at the start of the annual general
meeting been in office for three years or more
since his last appointment or re-appointment,
he shall retire at the annual general meeting.
As such, it is possible that a Director may be
in office for more than three years depending
upon the timing for calling the annual general
meeting.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

(c) Board meetings

During 2016, 9 Board meetings were held.
At the Board meeting held on 16 March 2017,
the Directors approved, among other things,
the annual results of the Company for the year
ended 31 December 2016.
The schedule for Board meetings is approved
on an annual basis. The Directors are then
provided on a timely basis with the relevant
documents and copies of the draft resolutions
to be considered at that particular meeting. All
Directors are given an opportunity to include
matters in the agenda for the Board meeting
and have access to the secretary of the Board
to ensure that all Board procedures and all
applicable rules are followed. The Board also
enables the Directors to seek independent
professional advice at the Company’s expense
in appropriate circumstances. The Board secretary is responsible for keeping minutes of
the Board meetings and the secretary of the
Company is responsible for the safe-keeping
of minutes and resolutions of the Board at the
registered office of the Company.

185

(d) Board functions and duties

The Board is collectively responsible for the
management and operations of the Company.
The principal functions and duties conferred
on the Board include:
responsibility for the approval and
monitoring of the overall development
strategies, annual budgets, business
plans and material investment plans
relating to the Company’s businesses;
m onitoring and evaluating the performance of the Company in respect of
its strategies, budgets and plans;
approving and supervising the man
agement;
 iving an account of the Company’s
g
activities to the parties to whom an
account is properly due; and
 nsuring the maintenance of accounte
ing records in compliance with the legal obligations of the Company.
The Board has delegated the day-to-day operation of the Group to executive Directors and
the executive committee to ensure effectiveness and appropriateness of functions.
The primary role of the executive committee
is to assist the Chief Executive Officer and senior management with the day-to-day management of the Group and to assist the Board
in formulating and implementing the strategy
of the Group and monitoring its performance.

186

Additional duties and responsibilities of the
executive committee include, but are not limited to, developing Group strategy for Board
approval and implementing such strategy once
approved, reviewing and opining on any matter involving expenditure of more than USD75
million before referring such matter to the
Board, and overseeing and monitoring the financial performance of the Group. In addition,
the executive committee is empowered to establish committees comprising of its members,
as well as other managers from time to time.
The executive committee meets as frequently
as necessary, at minimum twice per month.
The executive committee operates as the management board of RUSAL Global. The Chief Executive Officer formally reports the decisions
and actions of the executive committee to the
Board at Board meetings.

(e) Board powers to issue shares

The Board has been given authority by the
Company’s Shareholders to issue Shares. The
mandate is described on page 106 of this Annual Report.

(f) Relationships among members of the
Board

Please refer to the profiles of Directors and
Senior Management for more information
about the relationships among members of
the Board.

(g) Shareholders’ Agreements

The Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company
and the Shareholders’ Agreement between Major
Shareholders were both entered into on 22 January 2010 and are still in force. For brief details of
these shareholders’ agreements, please see Appendix A and Appendix B.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

(h) Shareholder Options

The Glencore Call Option granted by Glencore
to En+ and SUAL Partners to acquire all Shares
held by Glencore lapsed on 26 March 2017.

(i) Board meetings at which Directors
have material interests
A.1.7 of the CG Code states that “If a substantial shareholder or a director has a conflict of
interest in a matter to be considered by the
board which the board has determined to be
material, the matter should be dealt with by a
physical board meeting rather than a written
resolution. Independent non-executive directors who, and whose close associates, have no
material interest in the transaction should be
present at that board meeting.”

The Board generally endeavoured throughout
the twelve-month period ended 31 December
2016 to ensure that it did not deal with business by the way of written resolution where a
substantial Shareholder of the Company or a
Director had disclosed an interest in a matter
to be considered by the Board which the Board
determined to be material. As a result, there
were only 3 occurrences (out of the 27 written
resolutions the Board passed during the period) when urgent business was dealt with by
the Board by way of written resolution where
a material interest of a Director was stated to
have been disclosed. In those instances, the
interest of the Director was a potential conflict
of interest by virtue of the fact that:
(1) a Director was also a member of the supervisory council for the parent company
of the entity contracting with the Company;
(2) a Director was also a member of the supervisory council for the parent company
of the entity contracting with the Company. Additionally, another Director was the
chairman of the supervisory board of the
parent company of the entity contracting
with the Company; and
(3) a Director was also a member of the supervisory council for the parent company
of the entity contracting with the Company.
On those occurrences, the written resolutions
were passed by the requisite majority excluding the materially interested Director.
Of the 9 Board meetings held in the twelvemonth period ended 31 December 2016 where
one or more Directors had disclosed a material interest, all the independent non-executive
Directors were present at all 9 of the Board
meetings held.
Of the 9 Board meetings held, there were 5 occasions where an independent non-executive
Director had a material interest in the transaction. On such occurrences, the independent
non-executive Director abstained from voting
and the resolutions approving entry into such
transactions were passed by the requisite majority excluding the materially interested independent non-executive Director.

4. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

The roles of the Chairman of the Board and
the Chief Executive Officer are segregated and
are independent to each other. The Chairman
(being Mr. Matthias Warnig) is chiefly responsible for maintaining the effective operation of
the Board. The Chairman is also responsible
for chairing Board meetings, briefing Board
members on issues discussed at Board meetings and ensuring good corporate governance
practices and procedures are established. The
role as Chief Executive Officer is primarily concerned with the supervision of the execution
of the policies determined by the Board particularly in the areas of production and supply chain, financial management and corporate finance, sales and marketing and others.
The Company has approved a policy statement
setting out those responsibilities to be undertaken by the Chairman and those to be undertaken by the Chief Executive Officer. The
Chairman is responsible for leadership of the
Board and for creating the conditions necessary to allow the Board and individual Directors to operate effectively. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Group and ensuring that
the strategic decisions made by the Board are
implemented.

5. Independent non-executive Directors

Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules requires that
an issuer must appoint independent non-executive Directors representing at least one-third
of the board. The current composition of the
Board represents an appropriate mix of Directors which offers sufficient independent checks
and balances and an appropriate governance
structure for the Company. As at the Latest
Practicable Date, the Company had 6 out of
18 Directors who are independent non-executive Directors, and there is no change in the
shareholders’ agreement in relation to board
nominations/appointments (as described on
pages 287 and 288 of the Company’s prospectus dated 31 December 2009).

188

The Board believes that all independent nonexecutive Directors have appropriate and
sufficient industry or finance experience and
qualifications to carry out their duties so as
to protect the interests of Shareholders of
the Company. Each of the independent nonexecutive Directors has undertaken to inform
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission as soon as
practicable if there is any subsequent change
of circumstances which may affect their independence. The Company has also received a
written confirmation from each of the independent non-executive Directors in respect of
their independence. The Board considers that
all independent non-executive Directors are
independent by reference to the factors stated
in the Listing Rules.

6. Nomination of Directors and the work
of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee

The Company established a corporate governance and nomination committee with written
terms of reference in compliance with the CG
Code.
The primary functions of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee are, among
other things, to develop, recommend and annually review corporate governance guidelines, policies and practices for the Company
and its consolidated subsidiaries, to oversee
corporate governance matters, to review and
monitor the Company’s policies and practices
on compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, to review and monitor the training and continuous professional development
of Directors and senior management, to develop, review and monitor the Company’s code of
conduct and compliance manual and applicable to employees and Directors, reviewing the
Company’s compliance with the CG Code set
out in Appendix 14 of the Listing Rules and disclosure in the Corporate Governance Report,
and to make recommendations to the Board,
including those in relation to the appointment
and removal of Directors. The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee is provided with sufficient resources to discharge its
duties and its terms of reference also permit it
to obtain access to a legal adviser.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

In recommending a candidate for appointment
to the Board, the Corporate Governance and
Nomination Committee is required to determine criteria, objectives and procedures for
selecting Board members, including factors
such as independence (in the case of independent non-executive directors), diversity, age,
future succession planning, integrity, skills,
expertise, experience, knowledge about the
Company’s business and industry, and willingness to devote adequate time and effort
to Board responsibilities. In identifying suitable candidates the Corporate Governance
and Nomination Committee is required to use
open advertising or the services of external
advisers to facilitate the search, consider candidates from a wide range of backgrounds and
consider candidates on merit against objective criteria, taking care that appointees have
enough time to devote to the position.

The Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee has held 7 meetings during the Review Period. At these meetings, the Corporate
Governance and Nomination Committee considered, amongst other things, (i) the annual general meeting materials, (ii) the recommendation
of qualified individuals to the Board, including
Mr. Bernard Zonneveld, Mr. Siegfried Wolf and
Mr. Marco Musetti, (iii) changes to the composition of the Board committees and (iv) Board of
Directors’ performance self-evaluation.

The Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee consists of a majority of independent non-executive Directors. The members
are as follows:

According to the Articles of Association, at every annual general meeting, one-third of the
Directors or, if their number is not three or
a multiple of three, the number nearest to
one-third shall retire from office; but if any
Director has at the start of the annual general
meeting been in office for three years or more
since his last appointment or re-appointment,
he shall retire at the annual general meeting. The Directors to retire by rotation shall
be, first, those who wish to retire and not be
re-appointed to office and, second, those who
have been longest in office since their last
appointment or re-appointment. As between
persons who became or were last re-appointed as Directors on the same day, those to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among
themselves) be determined by lot. The details
of the Directors who will retire and offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming annual general meeting are set out in the relevant
circular issued by the Company.

Director)

Report.

The Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee also monitors the implementation
of the Board Diversity Policy of the Company.
The Company recognizes and embraces the
benefits of having a diverse Board to enhance
the quality of its performance. The current
mix of skills, experience and other diversity
criteria of directors, including but not limited
to sex, age, nationality and educational background, provides for a balanced composition

7. Information relating to the remuneration policy and the work of the Remuneration Committee

The Company has established a remuneration
committee with written terms of reference in
compliance with the CG Code. The primary
functions of the Remuneration Committee are,
among other things, to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration package of the Directors and senior management,
and to assist the Board in overseeing the administration of the Company’s compensation
and benefits plans. Remuneration policies are
determined on the basis of an employee’s
qualifications and performance, as well as the
complexity of his or her job. Wages for each
employee are generally reviewed annually and
revised in accordance with a performance assessment and local labour market conditions.
The Remuneration Committee consists of a
majority of independent non-executive Directors. The members are as follows:

results and cash flow for that period.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

The Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires
the Directors to prepare consolidated financial
statements for each financial year which give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Company and its subsidiaries and of the
profit or loss of the Company and its subsidiaries for that period. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, the Directors
are required to:

The Chief Financial Officer of the Group is required to regularly present and explain to the
Audit Committee and the Board reports on the
Group’s financial position and operating results, and report other matters that may have
a material impact upon the financial performance and operations in order that the Audit
Committee and the Board may make informed
decisions.

elect suitable accounting policies and
s
apply them consistently;

The consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The
reporting responsibility of the external auditors of the Company on the financial statements of the Group are set out in the independent auditors’ report on pages 204 to 209 of

position of the Company and enable them to
ensure that the consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey)
Law 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

11. Risk Management and Internal Control

The Company’s risk management and internal control systems have been designed to
achieve strategic objectives of the Company,
safeguard the assets of the Company, determine the nature and extent of the risks, maintain proper accounting records, ensure execution with appropriate authority and compliance
with relevant laws and regulations. The risk
management system has always represented
the core part of the Company’s internal control
system, however it has become of even greater importance due to the increased level of
uncertainty and volatility on global markets.
The Board fully acknowledges its responsibility to establish and maintain appropriate and
effective risk management and internal control systems that are designed to achieve the
Company’s strategic objectives based on compliance with the risk appetite of shareholders
alongside with interests of other stakeholders.

195

In accordance with CG Code provision C.2.1.,
the Board reviews the Company’s risk management and internal control systems on a
quarterly basis to ensure their effectiveness.
The Company has an internal audit function in
the bounds of the Directorate for Control, internal audit and business coordination (hereinafter referred to as the Directorate for Control) and Audit Committee that carry out the
analysis and independent appraisal of the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk
management and internal control systems.
The Board and the Directorate for Control provide assurance in terms of adequacy of resources, staff qualifications and experience,
training programs and budgets of the core
functions of the Group such as accounting, internal audit and financial reporting. The Board
has established a risk management group
within the Directorate for control, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the
Company’s risk management policies. The risk
management group includes employees that
are appropriately qualified to manage financial, operational and compliance risks. The Directorate for Control reports regularly to the
Board on its activities including those related
to the risk management system.
The Company aims to promote a risk-based
thinking among all its employees including
all the management layers and those directly
engaged in the production process. The Company’s risk management policies, that are designed to identify, analyze and manage the
risks, are delivered to relevant employees
so that they could understand the coherence
between their responsibilities and the risks
faced by the Company as a whole. Thus, all
the Company risks are consolidated in the Risk
Map of the Company that is being monitored
by all the management layers and responsible

196

employees are allocated to each risk. The Directorate for Control considers risk management instruments to be applied for each risk.
Annual insurance program is developed based
on the risk map of the Company. In respect of
potentially risky instruments, such as hedging of commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, require special approval by the hedge committee of the
Company. Such a transparent attitude to risk
management improves risk awareness of employees including understanding of appropriate risk limits, relevant controls and instruments to monitor risks, adherence to risk
limits alongside with the ability to respond to
the changes of the business environment on a
timely basis.
The Company’s Audit Committee oversees
how management monitors compliance with
the Company’s risk management policies and
procedures and reviews the adequacy of the
risk management framework in relation to the
risks faced by the Company. The Company’s
Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight
role by the Company’s internal audit function,
which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the
Audit Committee.
The Board, the Company’s Audit Committee
and the Directorate for Control aim to ensure
that the internal control capability is regularly
improved and enhanced. However it is important to note that the Company’s internal control
and risk management system are designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure
to achieve business objectives, and can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance
against material misstatement or loss.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

The results of the Board’s quarterly reviews of
the Company’s risk management and internal
control system during the year 2016 are as
follows:
Operational Controls
Operational controls are established for management of a wide range of risks, including
those related to the production process, procurement, cash flow management, foreign
currency exchange rates, fraud, competitors,
politics etc. (i.e. other than those related to
compliance and financial reporting), covering
the core scope of the Directorate for Control.
The Audit Committee issues an annual plan
of audits and revisions to be performed in 12
months. However, unplanned audits and revisions are performed on a regular basis to
guarantee that operational controls are effective and efficient. The operational controls
system is based on either best practice patterns or recommendations of audits and revisions (compliance to such recommendation
is also regularly checked). The Directorate for
Control reports to the Board on results of audits and revisions on a quarterly basis. During the year 2016 the Directorate for controls
assessed all the material risks identified and
developed relevant risk management patterns
to be applied for them in accordance with the
Company’s risk management policies and risk
appetites of shareholders.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

Financial Controls
The Company’s risk management and internal
control systems are effective in terms of financial controls as the Board fully acknowledges
its responsibility to provide stakeholders with
true and fair financial statements which reflect all the material aspects of the Company
affairs and thus might be used for reasonable decisions. The financial reporting function is regularly audited by the Directorate for
Control and external auditors to prevent material misstatement due to fraud or error. The
Board aims to increase the level of automation
of the financial reporting function on an on-going
basis to increase efficiency and effectiveness of financial controls of the Company. The
Board ensures that financial controls of the
Company are strong and based on best practice patterns. Financial controls are checked
in the bounds of all the audits and revisions
performed by the Directorate for Control.
Compliance Controls
The Company operates in five continents having business affairs in many countries all over
the globe which creates a need to comply with
various legal requirements including those related to environment. The Board and the Directorate for Control acknowledge the importance to comply with legal and environmental
requirements in order to be a green aluminum
manufacturer and a good corporate citizen.
Compliance controls are checked in the bounds
of all the audits and revisions performed by
the Directorate for Control.

197

The internal control and risk management capability is regularly improved and enhanced.
The key steps and directions thereof for the
year 2016 are as follows:

Creating value / Annual report 2016

Information Disclosure Controls
Since the Company’s listing, it has been subject to requirements relating to continuous
disclosure obligations, including determination and disclosure of inside information. In
the beginning of 2010, the Board delegated its
authority to assess whether information constitutes inside information, whether it is subject to immediate disclosure or whether any
safe harbor provisions may apply; to determine the timing and format of disclosure; to
appoint officers responsible for collection, preliminary analysis and processing of the information within various business subdivisions of
the Group; to appoint the Company’s authorized representatives to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange; and to decide on trading halts and
other issues to be raised with the disclosure
committee. At the same time, internal policy
regulating the treatment of inside information
was adopted within the Group.
The internal control system applied in the
Group with respect to inside information ensures that any piece of information that may
constitute inside information is promptly escalated to the disclosure committee and, should
it constitute inside information, is disclosed.
Disclosure of inside information is made
through the tools available to the Company under applicable legislation in every jurisdiction
where the Company is subject to such disclosure (e.g. via the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
web-page in Hong Kong, Businesswire agency
in France and Interfax agency in Russia).
It is important to note that the Directorate for
Control did not identify in the year 2016 any
significant violations of operational, financial or
compliance controls and any significant risks
such as those that may potentially give rise to
uncertainties about ability of the Company to
continue to operate as a going concern.

12. Relevant Officers’ Securities Transactions

The Company has also adopted a code for Securities Transactions by Relevant Officers of
the Company. The Relevant Officers Code was
based on Appendix 10 to the Listing Rules but
it was made more exacting. It was also based
on the requirements of the French Monetary
and Financial Code, the General Regulation
of the AMF and the EU Market Abuse Regulation with respect to insider dealing and market
misconduct. It applies to any employee of the
Company or a director or employee of a subsidiary of the Company who, because of such
office or employment, is likely to be in possession of unpublished inside information in relation to the Company or its securities.
The Company has not been notified of any
transaction by any Relevant Officer in application of requirements of the French monetary
and financial code and the General Regulations of the AMF.

Independent
Auditors’ Report
To the members of United Company RUSAL Plc.
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial
statements of United Company RUSAL Plc (the
“Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”),
which comprise the consolidated statement of
financial position as at 31 December 2016, the
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash
flows for the year then ended, and notes,
comprising significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2016,
and its consolidated financial performance and
its consolidated cash flows for the year then
ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and have
been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991
and the disclosure requirements of the Hong
Kong Companies Ordinance.

204

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs).
Our responsibilities under those standards are
further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance
with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in
our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These
matters were addressed in the context of our
audit of the consolidated financial statements
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion
on these matters.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

Independent Auditors’ Report-continued
Valuation of property, plant and equipment
Please refer to the Note 13 in the financial statements.

The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed
in our audit

The Group has significant property, plant
and equipment balance which is material to
the financial statements as at 31 December
2016. Due to current global market conditions and continuing volatility, industry
downturn and overproduction there is a risk
that the above may be not recoverable in full
while devaluation of national currencies, decline in oil prices and tight cost control may
indicate that some previously impaired property, plant and equipment items may demonstrate a need for reversal of impairment.
This is specifically related to such cash generating units (“CGUs”) as Bauxite Company
of Guyana Inc., Armenal, Ural Foil, Kubikenborg Aluminium AB, Aughinish Alumina Ltd,
Kremniy, Windalco, Kandalaksha smelter and
Irkutsk smelter.

For all CGUs we obtained the discounted cash
flow forecasts prepared by management.

As at the reporting date management performs valuation of the recoverable amount of
the Group’s assets and cash generating units
as their value in use.

We challenged:
the key assumptions for long term growth
rates in the forecasts by comparing them
with historical results, economic and industry forecasts;

Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
forecasting and discounting future cash flows,
which are the basis of the assessment of recoverability, this is one of the key judgmental
areas that our audit is concentrated on.

We evaluated the reasonableness of the expected cash flow forecasts by comparing
them with the latest Board approved budgets,
externally derived data as well as our own
assessments in relation to key inputs such
as production level, forecasted aluminium
sales prices, cost inflation, foreign currency
exchange rates and discount rates. We also
considered the historic accuracy of management’s forecasts by comparing prior year
forecasts to actual results.
We used our own valuation specialist to assist
us in evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the Group.

the discount rates used. Specifically, we
recalculated the Group’s weighted average cost of capital using market comparable information.
We also performed sensitivity analysis on the
discounted cash flow forecasts and assessed
whether the Group’s disclosures about the
sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment
assessment to changes in key assumptions,
including forecasted aluminium and alumina
prices and discount rates, reflected the risks
inherent in the valuation of property, plant
and equipment.

Compliance with provisions of debt arrangements
Please refer to the Note 19 in the financial statements.

The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed
in our audit

The Group has significant debt on its statement of financial position as at 31 December
2016. Each debt arrangement includes financial and non-financial covenants.

Our procedures included:
challenging the Group level processes for
compliance with provisions of debt arrangements, including regular monitoring
of financial and non-financial compliance
criteria by the management and those
charged with governance, and their effectiveness in respect of compliance with
debt covenants;

Potential non-compliance with terms of debt
arrangements creates the risk of inappropriate classification and presentation of loans in
the financial statements as well as liquidity
risks for the Group.

inspecting new loan agreements, adden
dums to existing loan agreements in effect as at 31 December 2016 to ensure
that all covenant requirements have been
identified;
inspecting all communication with banks
and other creditors in terms of waivers
and adjustments to loan terms to ensure
that all covenant requirements have been
identified and correctly accounted for;
recalculation of financial covenants and
performing procedures to assess whether
non-financial covenants have been appropriately complied with and whether classification of loans is appropriate in the financial statements.

Other Information
The Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
the information included in the Group’s Annual
Report apart from the consolidated financial
statements and apart from auditors’ report
thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be
made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is
to read the other information identified above
when it becomes available and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained
in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

Responsibilities
of Directors
and Those
Charged with
Governance for
the Consolidated
Financial
Statements

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, directors are responsible for assessing
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern and using the going concern
basis of accounting unless directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to
do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

Auditors’
Responsibilities
for the Audit of
the Consolidated
Financial
Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,
and to issue an auditors’ report that includes
our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if,
individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
these consolidated financial statements.

The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with IFRS
and the disclosure requirements of the Hong
Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

Independent Auditors’ Report-continued
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs,
we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the
audit. We also:
I dentify and assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud
or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
btain an understanding of internal
O
control relevant to the audit in order to
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal
control.
E valuate the appropriateness of ac
counting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by Directors.
 onclude on the appropriateness of the
C
Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’
report to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or,
if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are
based on the audit evidence obtained up
to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may
cause the Group to cease to continue as
a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated
financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that achieves fair presentation.
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of
the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied
with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and communicate with them
all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those
charged with governance, we determine those
matters that were of most significance in the
audit of the consolidated financial statements
of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in
our auditors’ report unless law or regulation
precludes public disclosure about the matter
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is
Yerkozha Akylbek.

1 Background
(a) Organisation
United Company RUSAL Plc (the “Company” or
“UC RUSAL”) was established by the controlling shareholder of RUSAL Limited (“RUSAL”)
as a limited liability company under the laws
of Jersey on 26 October 2006. On 27 January
2010, the Company successfully completed a
dual placing on the Main Board of The Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (“Stock Exchange”) and the Professional Segment of
NYSE Euronext Paris (“Euronext Paris”) (the
“Global Offering”) and changed its legal form
from a limited liability company to a public
limited company.

On 23 March 2015, the shares of the Company were admitted to listing on PJSC Moscow
Exchange MICEX-RTS (“Moscow Exchange”) in
the First Level quotation list. The trading of
shares on Moscow Exchange commenced on
30 March 2015. There was no issue of new
shares.
The Company’s registered office is 44 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, JE4 9WG, Channel Islands.
The Company directly or through its wholly
owned subsidiaries controls a number of production and trading entities (refer to note 26)
engaged in the aluminium business and other
entities, which together with the Company are
referred to as “the Group”.
The shareholding structure of the Company as
at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015
was as follows:

Ultimate beneficiary of En+ is Mr. Oleg Deripaska. Ultimate beneficiary of Onexim is Mr.
Mikhail Prokhorov. Major ultimate beneficiaries of SUAL Partners are Mr. Victor Vekselberg
and Mr. Len Blavatnik. Amokenga Holdings is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Glencore International Plc (“Glencore”).
In February 2017 Onexim has disposed of
3.3% of its shares in the Company which
resulted in decrease of its shareholding to
13.72% and increase of publicly held shareholding to 13.35%.
At 31 December 2016 and 2015, the directors
consider the immediate parent of the Group to
be En+, which is incorporated in Jersey with
its registered office at 44 Esplanade, St Helier,
Jersey, JE4 9WG, Channel Islands. En+ is controlled by Fidelitas International Investments
Corp. (a company incorporated in Panama)
through its wholly-owned subsidiary. Mr. Oleg
V. Deripaska is the founder, the trustee and a
principal beneficiary of a discretionary trust,
which controls Fidelitas International Investments Corp. None of these entities produce
financial statements available for public use.

disclosed

(b) Deconsolidation and disposal of
subsidiaries
In 2015 the Group deconsolidated ZALK and a
another subsidiary, as a result of which USD95
million foreign currency translation gain was
recycled through profit and loss.
In July 2016 the Group entered into an agreement to sell its 100% stake in the Alumina
Partners of Jamaica (“Alpart”) to the Chinese
state industrial group, JIUQUAN IRON & STEEL
(GROUP) Co. Ltd. (“JISCO”) for a consideration of USD298 million. In November 2016
the Group completed the sale of Alpart and
received the full consideration in cash.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

(c) Operations
The Group operates in the aluminium industry
primarily in the Russian Federation, Ukraine,
Guinea, Jamaica, Ireland, Italy, Nigeria and
Sweden and is principally engaged in the mining and refining of bauxite and nepheline ore
into alumina, the smelting of primary aluminium from alumina and the fabrication of aluminium and aluminium alloys into semi-fabricated and finished products. The Group sells
its products primarily in Europe, Russia, other
countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (“CIS”), Asia and North America.

(d) Business environment in emerging
economies
The Russian Federation, Ukraine, Jamaica,
Nigeria and Guinea have been experiencing
political and economic changes that have affected, and may continue to affect, the activities of enterprises operating in these environments. Consequently, operations in these
countries involve risks that typically do not
exist in other markets, including reconsideration of privatisation terms in certain countries
where the Group operates following changes
in governing political powers.
The conflict in Ukraine and related events has
increased the perceived risks of doing business in the Russian Federation. The imposition
of economic sanctions on Russian individuals
and legal entities by the European Union, the
United States of America, Japan, Canada, Australia and others, as well as retaliatory sanctions imposed by the Russian government, has
resulted in increased economic uncertainty
including more volatile equity markets, a depreciation of the Russian Ruble, a reduction
in both local and foreign direct investment inflows and a significant tightening in the availability of credit. In particular, some Russian
entities may be experiencing difficulties in
accessing international equity and debt markets and may become increasingly dependent
on Russian state banks to finance their operations. The longer term effects of recently
implemented sanctions, as well as the threat
of additional future sanctions, are difficult to
determine.

219

The consolidated financial statements reflect
management’s assessment of the impact of
the Russian, Ukrainian, Jamaican, Nigerian
and Guinean business environments on the
operations and the financial position of the
Group. The future business environment may
differ from management’s assessment.

2 Basis of
preparation
(a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”),
which collective term includes all International
Accounting Standards and related interpretations, promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), and the
disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong
Companies Ordinance.
These financial statements also comply with
the applicable disclosure provisions of the
Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.
In preparing these financial statement the Group
has applied the following standards and interpretations which are effective in respect of the
financial years beginning on 1 January 2016.

As part of applying Amendments to IAS 1: Disclosure Initiative the Group has adopted a new
presentation approach which would provide
more relevant, clear and concise presentation
and disclosures. Other above mentioned standards have not had significant impact on these
consolidated financial statements.
The IASB has issued the following amendments,
new standards and interpretations which are
not yet effective in respect of the financial years
included in these consolidated financial statements, and which have not been adopted in
these consolidated financial statements.

The Group is in the process of making an assessment of what the impact of these amendments, new standards and new interpretations
is expected to be in the period of initial application. So far the Group has identified some
aspects of the new standards which may have
a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Further details of the expected impacts are discussed below. As the Group
has not completed its assessment, further impacts may be identified in due course and will
be taken into consideration when determining
whether to adopt any of these new requirements before their effective date and which
transitional approach to take, where there are
alternative approaches allowed under the new
standards.

IFRS 9, Financial instruments
IFRS 9 will replace the current standard on
accounting for financial instruments, IAS 39,
Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement. IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classification and measurement of
financial assets, calculation of impairment of
financial assets and hedge accounting. On the
other hand, IFRS 9 incorporates without substantive changes the requirements of IAS 39
for recognition and derecognition of financial
instruments and the classification of financial liabilities. Expected impacts of the new
requirements on the Group’s financial statements are as follows:

Creating value / Annual report 2016

1 January 2018
1 January 2018
1 January 2019

(i) Classification and measurement
IFRS 9 contains three principal classification
categories for financial assets: measured at
(1) amortised cost, (2) fair value through
profit or loss and (3) fair value through other
comprehensive income as follows:
 he classification for debt instruments is
T
determined based on the entity’s business
model for managing the financial assets
and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. If a debt instrument is
classified as fair value through other comprehensive income then effective interest,
impairments and gains/losses on disposal
will be recognised in profit or loss.
 or equity securities, the classification is
F
fair value through profit or loss regardless
of the entity’s business model. The only
exception is if the equity security is not
held for trading and the entity irrevocably elects to designate that security as fair
value through other comprehensive income. If an equity security is designated
as fair value through other comprehensive
income then only dividend income on that
security will be recognised in profit or loss.
Gains, losses and impairments on that security will be recognised in other comprehensive income without recycling.

221

Based on the preliminary assessment, the
Group expects that its financial assets currently measured at amortised cost and fair
value through profit or loss will continue with
their respective classification and measurements upon the adoption of IFRS 9.
The classification and measurement requirements for financial liabilities under IFRS 9
are largely unchanged from IAS 39, except
that IFRS 9 requires the fair value change of
a financial liability designated at fair value
through profit or loss that is attributable to
changes of that financial liability’s own credit risk to be recognised in other comprehensive income (without reclassification to profit
or loss). The Group currently does not have
any financial liabilities designated at fair value
through profit or loss and therefore this new
requirement may not have any impact on the
group on adoption of IFRS 9.

(ii) Impairment
The new impairment model in IFRS 9 replaces
the “incurred loss” model in IAS 39 with an
“expected credit loss” model. Under the expected credit loss model, it will no longer be
necessary for a loss event to occur before an
impairment loss is recognised. Instead, an
entity is required to recognise and measure
expected credit losses as either 12-month
expected credit losses or lifetime expected
credit losses, depending on the asset and the
facts and circumstances. This new impairment
model may result in an earlier recognition of
credit losses on the Group’s trade receivables
and other financial assets. However, a more
detailed analysis is required to determine the
extent of the impact.

222

(iii) Hedge accounting
IFRS 9 does not fundamentally change the
requirements relating to measuring and recognising ineffectiveness under IAS 39. However, greater flexibility has been introduced
to the types of transactions eligible for hedge
accounting. The Group preliminarily assesses
that its current hedge relationships will qualify as continuing hedges upon the adoption of
IFRS 9 and therefore it does not expect that
the accounting for its hedging relationships
will be significantly impacted.

IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with
customers
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for recognising revenue from contracts
with customers. IFRS 15 will replace the existing revenue standards, IAS 18, Revenue, which
covers revenue arising from sale of goods and
rendering of services, and IAS 11, Construction contracts, which specifies the accounting
for revenue from construction contracts.
The Group is currently assessing the impacts of
adopting IFRS 15 on its financial statements.
Based on the preliminary assessment, the
Group has identified the following areas which
are likely to be affected:

(i) Timing of revenue recognition
The Group’s revenue recognition policies are
disclosed in note 5. Currently, revenue arising from sale of goods is generally recognised
when the risks and rewards of ownership have
passed to the customers.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when
the customer obtains control of the promised good or service in the contract. IFRS 15
identifies 3 situations in which control of the
promised good or service is regarded as being
transferred over time:
(1) When the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance, as the
entity performs;
(2) When the entity’s performance creates or
enhances an asset (for example work in
progress) that the customer controls as
the asset is created or enhanced;
(3) When the entity’s performance does not
create an asset with an alternative use to
the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance
completed to date.
If the contract terms and the entity’s activities do not fall into any of these 3 situations,
then under IFRS 15 the entity recognises revenue for the sale of that good or service at a
single point in time, being when control has
passed. Transfer of risks and rewards of ownership is only one of the indicators that will be
considered in determining when the transfer
of control occurs.
As a result of this change from the risk-andreward approach to the contract-by-contract
transfer-of-control approach, it is possible
that for some of the Group’s contracts the
point in time when revenue is recognised may
be earlier or later than under the current accounting policy. However, further analysis is
required to determine whether this change in
accounting policy may have a material impact
on the amounts reported in any given financial
reporting period.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

(ii) Significant financing component
IFRS 15 requires an entity to adjust the transaction price for the time value of money when
a contract contains a significant financing component, regardless of whether the payments
from customers are received significantly in
advance or in arrears.
Currently, the Group would only apply such
a policy when payments are significantly deferred, which is currently not common in the
Group’s arrangements with its customers. Currently, the Group does not apply such a policy
when payments are received in advance.
The Group is in the process of assessing whether this component in the Group’s advance payment schemes would be significant to the contract and therefore whether, once IFRS 15 is
adopted, the transaction price would need to
be adjusted for the purposes of recognising
revenue.

IFRS 16, Leases
IFRS 16 provides a comprehensive model for
the identification of lease arrangements and
their treatment in the financial statements of
both lessees and lessors. It will replace the
following lease standard and Interpretations
upon its effective date: IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC
4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases – Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance
of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a
Lease.
The Group is currently assessing the impacts of
adopting IFRS 16 on its financial statements.

223

Based on the preliminary assessment, the
Group has identified the following area which
is likely to be affected: classification and recognition of lease assets and liabilities. The
Group estimates that insignificant amounts
related to leases may be recognised in the
Group’s statement of financial position.
IFRS 16 introduces significant changes to lessee accounting: it removes the distinction between operating and finance leases under IAS
17 and requires a lessee to recognise a rightof-use asset and a lease liability at lease commencement for all leases, except for shortterm leases and leases of low value assets.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at
cost and subsequently measured at cost (subject to certain exceptions) less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted
for any remeasurement of the lease liability.
The lease liability is initially measured at the
present value of the lease payments that are
not paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease
liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications, amongst others.
If a lessee elects not to apply the general requirements of IFRS 16 to short-term leases
(i.e. one that does not include a purchase option and has a lease term at commencement
date of 12 months or less) and leases of low
value assets, the lessee should recognise the
lease payments associated with those leases
as an expense on either a straight-line basis
over the lease term or another systematic basis, similar to the current accounting for operating leases.

224

(b) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with the historical
cost basis except as set out in the significant
accounting policies in the relates notes below.

(c) Functional and presentation currency
The Company’s functional currency is the
United States Dollar (“USD”) because it reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances of the Company.
The functional currencies of the Group’s significant subsidiaries are the currencies of the
primary economic environment and key business processes of these subsidiaries and include USD, Russian Rubles (“RUB”), Ukrainian
Hryvna and Euros (“EUR”). The consolidated
financial statements are presented in USD,
rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise stated herein.

(d) Use of judgements, estimates and
assumptions
The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with IFRSs requires
management to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions that affect the application
of accounting policies and reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported
revenue and costs during the relevant period.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

Management bases its judgements and estimates on historical experience and various
other factors that are believed to be appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period
of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRSs that have a significant effect
on the consolidated financial statements and
estimates with a significant risk of material
adjustment in the next year relate to:
 easurement of recoverable amount
m
of property, plant and equipment
(note 13) and goodwill (note 14)
 easurement of net realizable value
m
of inventories (note 16);
 easurement of recoverable amount
m
of investments in associates (note 15);
estimates in respect of legal proceedings, restoration and exploration, taxation and pension reserve (note 20).

3 Significant
accounting
policies
Significant accounting policies are described in
the related notes to the financial statements
captions and in this note. The following significant accounting policies have been applied
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies and
judgements applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements are the same
as those applied by the Group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the
year ended 31 December 2015 and have been
consistently applied to all periods presented in
these consolidated financial statements.

(a) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the
group. The Group controls an entity when it
is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns
from its involvement with the entity and has
the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive
rights (held by the Group and other parties)
are considered.
An investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the consolidated financial statements
from the date that control commences until
the date that control ceases. Intra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the
consolidated financial statements. Unrealised
losses resulting from intra-group transactions
are eliminated in the same way as unrealised
gains but only to the extent that there is no
evidence of impairment.

225

When the group loses control of a subsidiary, it
is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in that subsidiary, with a resulting gain
or loss being recognised in profit or loss. Any
interest retained in that former subsidiary at
the date when control is lost is recognised at
fair value and this amount is regarded as the
fair value on initial recognition of a financial
asset or, when appropriate, the cost on initial
recognition of an investment in an associate or
joint venture.

(ii) Foreign operations

(ii) Transactions eliminated on
consolidation

Foreign currency differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and presented in the currency translation reserve in equity. For the
purposes of foreign currency translation, the
net investment in a foreign operation includes
foreign currency intra-group balances for
which settlement is neither planned nor likely
in the foreseeable future and foreign currency
differences arising from such a monetary item
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.

Intra-group balances and transactions, and
any unrealised income and expenses arising
from intra-group transactions, are eliminated
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are
eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same
way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent
that there is no evidence of impairment.

(b) Foreign currencies
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currencies of
Group entities at the exchange rates ruling at
the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to
the functional currency at the exchange rate
at that date. The foreign currency gain or loss
on monetary items is the difference between
the amortised cost in the functional currency
at the beginning of the period, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency
translated at the exchange rate at the end of
the reporting period. Non-monetary items in a
foreign currency are measured based on historical cost are translated using the exchange
rate at the date of transaction. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are
recognised in the statement of income, except
for differences arising on the retranslation of
qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent the
hedge is effective, which is recognised in the
other comprehensive income.

226

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated
from their functional currencies to USD at the
exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to USD at exchange rates
approximating exchange rates at the dates of
the transactions.

When a foreign operation is disposed of, such
that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of the currency translation reserve is transferred to the
statement of income as part of the gain or loss
on disposal. When the Group disposes of only
part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes
a foreign operation while retaining control, the
relevant proportion of the cumulative amount
is reattributed to non-controlling interests.
When the Group disposes of only part of its
investment in an associate or joint venture
that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the
relevant proportion of the cumulative amount
is reclassified to the statement of income.

4 Segment
reporting
(a) Reportable segments
An operating segment is a component of the
Group that engages in business activities from
which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, including revenue and expenses that relate
to transactions with any of the Group’s other
components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the
Group’s CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess
its performance and for which discrete consolidated financial information or statements
are available.
Individually material operating segments are
not aggregated for financial reporting purposes unless the segments have similar economic
characteristics and are similar in respect of
the nature of products and services, the nature of production processes, the type or class
of customers, the methods used to distribute
the products or provide the services and the
nature of the regulatory environment. Operating segments which are not individually material may be aggregated if they share a majority of these criteria.
The Group has four reportable segments, as
described below, which are the Group’s strategic business units. These business units are
managed separately and the results of their
operations are reviewed by the CEO on a regular basis.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

Aluminium. The Aluminium segment is involved in the production and sale of primary
aluminium and related products.
Alumina. The Alumina segment is involved in
the mining and refining of bauxite into alumina and the sale of alumina.
Energy. The Energy segment includes the
Group companies and projects engaged in the
mining and sale of coal and the generation and
transmission of electricity produced from various sources. Where the generating facility is
solely a part of an alumina or aluminium production facility it is included in the respective
reportable segment.
Mining and Metals. The Mining and Metals segment includes the equity investment in PJSC
MMC Norilsk Nickel (“Norilsk Nickel”).
Other operations include manufacturing of
semi-finished products from primary aluminium for the transportation, packaging, building and construction, consumer goods and
technology industries; and the activities of the
Group’s administrative centres. None of these
segments meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining reportable segments in
2016 and 2015.
The Aluminium and Alumina segments are
vertically integrated whereby the Alumina
segment supplies alumina to the Aluminium
segment for further refining and smelting with
limited sales of alumina outside the Group.
Integration between the Aluminium, Alumina
and Energy segments also includes shared
servicing and distribution.

227

(b) Segment results, assets and
liabilities
For the purposes of assessing segment performance and allocating resources between segments, the Group’s senior executive management monitor the results, assets and liabilities
attributable to each reportable segment on
the following bases:
Segment assets include all tangible, intangible
assets and current assets with the exception of
income tax assets and corporate assets. Segment liabilities include trade and other payables attributable to the production and sales
activities of the individual segments. Loans
and borrowings are not allocated to individual
segments as they are centrally managed by
the head office.
Revenue and expenses are allocated to the
reportable segments with reference to sales
generated by those segments and the expenses incurred by those segments or which otherwise arise from the depreciation or amortisation of assets attributable to those segments
excluding impairment.

228

The measure used for reporting segment results is the statement of income before income
tax adjusted for items not specifically attributed to individual segments, such as finance
income, costs of loans and borrowings and
other head office or corporate administration
costs. The segment profit or loss is included
in the internal management reports that are
reviewed by the Group’s CEO. Segment profit or loss is used to measure performance as
management believes that such information is
the most relevant in evaluating the results of
certain segments relative to other entities that
operate within these industries.
In addition to receiving segment information
concerning segment results, management is
provided with segment information concerning
revenue (including inter-segment revenue),
the carrying value of investments and share
of profits/(losses) of associates and joint ventures, depreciation, amortisation, impairment
and additions of non-current segment assets
used by the segments in their operations. Inter-segment pricing is determined on a consistent basis using market benchmarks.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost
incurred during the year to acquire property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets
other than goodwill.

(iii) Geographic information
The Group’s operating segments are managed
on a worldwide basis, but operate in four principal geographical areas: the CIS, Europe, Africa and the Americas. In the CIS, production
facilities operate in Russia and Ukraine. In Europe, production facilities are located in Italy,
Ireland and Sweden. African production facilities are represented by bauxite mines and an
alumina refinery in Guinea and an aluminium
plant in Nigeria. In the Americas the Group
operates one production facility in Jamaica,
one in Guyana and a trading subsidiary in the
United States of America.

232

The following table sets out information about
the geographical location of (i) the Group’s
revenue from external customers and (ii) the
Group’s property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and interests in associates
and joint ventures (“specified non-current assets”). The geographical location of customers
is based on the location at which the services
were provided or the goods were delivered.
The geographical location of the specified noncurrent assets is based on the physical location of the asset. Unallocated specified noncurrent assets comprise mainly goodwill and
interests in associates and joint ventures.

5 Revenue
Accounting policies
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the
associated costs and possible return of goods
can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the good
and the amount of revenue can be measured
reliably. This is generally when title passes.
If it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably,
then the discount is recognised as a reduction
of revenue as the sales are recognised.

234

For the majority of sales transactions agreements specify that title passes on the bill of
lading date, which is the date the commodity
is delivered to the shipping agent.
Revenue is not reduced for royalties or other
taxes payable from production.

(c) Personnel costs
Accounting policies
Personnel costs comprise salaries, annual bonuses, annual leave and cost of non-monetary
benefits. Salaries, annual bonuses, paid annual leave and cost of non-monetary benefits
are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees.
Where payment or settlement is deferred and
the effect would be material, these amounts
are stated at their present values.

terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed using the projected unit
credit method. When the calculation results in
a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset
is limited to the net total of any unrecognised
past service costs and the present value of
any future refunds from the plan or reductions
in future contributions to the plan.
Where there is a change in actuarial assumptions, the resulting actuarial gains and losses
are recognised directly in the statement of
comprehensive income.

The employees of the Group are also members
of retirement schemes operated by local authorities. The Group is required to contribute
a certain percentage of their payroll to these
schemes to fund the benefits. The Group’s total contribution to those schemes charged to
the statement of income during the years presented is shown below.

When the benefits of a plan are improved, the
portion of the increased benefit relating to
past service by employees is recognised in the
statement of income on a straight-line basis
over the average period until the benefits become vested. To the extent that the benefits
vest immediately, the expense is recognised
immediately.

The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans is calculated separately for each
plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for
their service in the current and prior periods;
that benefit is discounted to determine its
present value and any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets
are deducted. The discount rate is the yield
at the reporting date on government bonds
that have maturity dates approximating the

The Group recognises gains and losses on the
curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit
plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs.

238

The gain or loss on curtailment comprises any
resulting change in the fair value of plan assets, any change in the present value of the
defined benefit obligation, any related actuarial gains and losses and past service costs
that had not previously been recognised.

and expenses
Accounting policies
Finance income comprises interest income on
funds invested, changes in the fair value of
financial assets at fair value through profit or
loss and foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Finance expenses comprise interest expense
on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on
provisions, foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair
value through profit or loss. All borrowing
costs are recognised in the statement of income using the effective interest method, except for borrowing costs related to the acquisition, construction and production of qualifying
assets which are recognised as part of the cost
of such assets.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

8 Income tax
Accounting policies
Income tax expense comprises current and
deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of income and other
comprehensive income except to the extent
that it relates to items recognised directly in
equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the
taxable income for the year, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for
taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences:
the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial
recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and
that affects neither accounting nor taxable
profit, and differences relating to investments
in subsidiaries to the extent that they prob-

ably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
New information may become available that
causes the Company to change its judgement
regarding the adequacy of existing tax liability. Such changes to tax liabilities will impact
tax expenses in the period that such a determination is made. Deferred tax is measured
at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they
reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
offset when they relate to income taxes levied
by the same taxation authority and the Group
has both the right and the intention to settle
its current tax assets and liabilities on a net or
simultaneous basis.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable
profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax
assets are reviewed at each reporting date
and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will
be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the
distribution of dividends are recognised at the
same time as the liability to pay the related
dividends is recognised.

remittance of the earnings has been indefinitely postponed through reinvestment and,
as a result, such amounts are considered to

be permanently invested. It was not practicable to determine the amount of temporary
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the
timing of reversal of the difference. Reversal

13 Property, plant
and equipment
Accounting policies
(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment, are
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment at 1 January 2004,
the date of transition to IFRSs, was determined
by reference to its fair value at that date.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The
cost of self-constructed assets includes the
cost of materials and direct labour, any other
costs directly attributable to bringing the asset
to a working condition for its intended use, the
costs of dismantling and removing the items
and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalised borrowing costs. Purchased
software that is integral to the functionality of
the related equipment is capitalised as part of
that equipment.
When parts of an item of property, plant and
equipment have different useful lives, they are
accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
The cost of periodic relining of electrolysers is
capitalised and depreciated over the expected
production period.
Gains or losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by
comparing the proceeds from disposal with
the carrying amount of property, plant and
equipment, and are recognised net within
gain/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and
equipment in the statement of income.

(ii) Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the
carrying amount of the item if it is probable
that the future economic benefits embodied
within the part will flow to the Group and its
cost can be measured reliably. The carrying
amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in
the statement of income as incurred.

(iii) Exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation activities involve
the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource. Exploration and evaluation
activities include:
researching and analysing historical exploration data;
gathering exploration data through topographical, geochemical and geophysical studies;
e xploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;
determining and examining the volume
and grade of the resource;
surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements; and
conducting market and finance studies.
Administration costs that are not directly attributable to a specific exploration area are
charged to the statement of income.
License costs paid in connection with a right
to explore in an existing exploration area are
capitalised and amortised over the term of
the permit.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets
when it is expected that expenditure related to
an area of interest will be recouped by future
exploitation, sale, or, at the reporting date,
the exploration and evaluation activities have
not reached a stage that permits a reasonable
assessment of the existence of commercially
recoverable ore reserves. Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is recorded as
a component of property, plant and equipment
at cost less impairment losses. As the asset is
not available for use, it is not depreciated. All
capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is monitored for indications of impairment. Where there are indicators of potential impairment, an assessment is performed
for each area of interest in conjunction with
the group of operating assets (representing
a cash-generating unit) to which the exploration is attributed. Exploration areas at which
reserves have been discovered but which require major capital expenditure before production can begin are continually evaluated to
ensure that commercial quantities of reserves
exist or to ensure that additional exploration
work is underway or planned. To the extent

251

that capitalised expenditure is not expected to
be recovered it is charged to the statement of
income.
Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to mining property, plant and equipment or intangible assets when development
is sanctioned.

(iv) Stripping costs
Expenditure relating to the stripping of overburden layers of ore, including estimated site
restoration costs, is included in the cost of
production in the period in which it is incurred.

(v) Mining assets
Mining assets are recorded as construction in
progress and transferred to mining property,
plant and equipment when a new mine reaches commercial production.
Mining assets include expenditure incurred
for:
cquiring mineral and development
A
rights;
Developing new mining operations.
Mining assets include interest capitalised during the construction period, when financed by
borrowings.

252

(vi) Depreciation
The carrying amounts of property, plant and
equipment (including initial and any subsequent capital expenditure) are depreciated to
their estimated residual value over the estimated useful lives of the specific assets concerned, or the estimated life of the associated
mine or mineral lease, if shorter. Estimates of
residual values and useful lives are reassessed
annually and any change in estimate is taken
into account in the determination of remaining
depreciation charges. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term
and their useful lives. Freehold land is not depreciated.
The property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line or units of production basis over the respective estimated useful
lives as follows:
Buildings
Plant, machinery
and equipment
Electrolysers
M ining assets

Other (except for
exploration and
evaluation assets)

30 to 50 years;
5 to 40 years;
4 to 15 years;
units of production
on proven and
probable reserves;
1 to 20 years.

Included in disposals of property, plant and
equipment are disposals related to deconsolidation of Alpart (note 1(b)) of USD564 million
both at cost and accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation expense of USD426 million
(2015: USD421 million) has been charged to
cost of goods sold, USD3 million (2015: USD5
million) to distribution expenses and USD16
million (2015: USD17 million) to administrative expenses.
During the years ended 31 December 2016
and 2015, no interest cost was capitalised due
to postponement of construction projects as a
result of the economic environment.
Included into construction in progress at 31 December 2016 and 2015 are advances to suppliers of property, plant and equipment of USD89
million and USD41 million, respectively.
The carrying value of property, plant and
equipment subject to lien under loan agreements was USD225 million as at 31 December
2016 (31 December 2015: USD612 million),
refer to note 19.

(a) Impairment
In accordance with the Group’s accounting
policies, each asset or cash generating unit is
evaluated every reporting period to determine
whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, a formal
estimate of recoverable amount is performed
and an impairment loss recognised to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of
an asset or cash generating group of assets is
measured at the higher of fair value less costs
to sell and value in use.
Fair value is determined as the amount that
would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between
knowledgeable and willing parties and is generally determined as the present value of the
estimated future cash flows expected to arise
from the continued use of the asset, including any expansion prospects, and its eventual
disposal.

254

Value in use is also generally determined as
the present value of the estimated future cash
flows, but only those expected to arise from
the continued use of the asset in its present
form and its eventual disposal. Present values
are determined using a risk-adjusted pre-tax
discount rate appropriate to the risks inherent
in the asset. Future cash flow estimates are
based on expected production and sales volumes, commodity prices (considering current
and historical prices, price trends and related
factors), bauxite reserve estimate, operating
costs, restoration and rehabilitation costs and
future capital expenditure.
Bauxite reserves are estimates of the amount
of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s properties. In
order to calculate reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities, grades, production techniques,
recovery rates, production costs, transport
costs, commodity demand, commodity prices
and exchange rates. The Group determines
ore reserves under the Australasian Code for
Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves September 1999, known as the JORC
Code. The JORC Code requires the use of reasonable investment assumptions to calculate
reserves.
Management identified several factors that indicated that a number of the Group’s cashgenerating units may be impaired or see reversal of previously recognised impairment
loss. These include significant fluctuations in
the exchange rate of Russian Ruble throughout the year, significant decrease of aluminium
and alumina prices in the beginning of 2016
and their recovery by the end of the same period. In aluminium and silicon production, the
Group faced significant decrease in cash cost
due to depreciation of national currencies and
application of cash cost control measures. For
alumina cash generating units, major influence was on the part of recovery in alumina
prices and decrease in prices of energy resources being a significant part of cash cost.
In foil production, the price of primary thick
foils was low compared to that of more thinner
and sophisticated positions. Bauxite cash generating units faced decrease in the sale price
of bauxite.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

For the purposes of impairment testing the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit
was determined by discounting expected future
net cash flows of the cash generating unit.

Irkutsk smelter cash generating units in the
amounts of USD124 million, USD52 million,
USD48 million, USD38 million, USD30 million
and USD7 million, respectively.

Based on results of impairment testing as at
31 December 2016, management has concluded that an impairment loss relating to property, plant and equipment should be recognised
in these financial statements in respect of the
Bauxite Company of Guyana Inc., Armenal and
Ural Foil cash generating units in the amounts
of USD58 million, USD48 million and USD13
million, respectively, as the determined recoverable amount was negative. Management has
also concluded that a reversal of previously
recognised impairment loss relating to property, plant and equipment should be recognised
in these financial statements in respect of the
Kubikenborg Aluminium, Kremniy, Windalco,
Aughinish Alumina, Kandalaksha smelter and

Based on results of impairment testing for the
year 2015, management has concluded that
no impairment loss or reversal of previously
recognised impairment loss relating to property, plant and equipment should be recognised
in these financial statements.
For the purposes of impairment testing the
recoverable amount of each cash generating
unit was determined by discounting expected
future net cash flows of the cash generating
unit. The pre-tax discount rates applied to the
above mentioned cash generating units, estimated in nominal terms based on an industry
weighted average cost of capital, are presented in the table below.

The recoverable amount of a number of the
cash generating units tested for impairment
are particularly sensitive to changes in forecast aluminium and alumina prices, foreign
exchange rates and applicable discount rates.
Additionally, management identified specific
items of property, plant and equipment that are
no longer in use and therefore are not considered to be recoverable amounting to USD67 million at 31 December 2016 (2015: USD115 million). These assets have been impaired in full.
No further impairment of property, plant and
equipment or reversal of previously recorded
impairment was identified by management.

(b) Leased assets
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Upon initial recognition the leased asset is
measured at an amount equal to the lower of
its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial
recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable
to that asset.

256

The corresponding finance lease obligation is
included within interest bearing liabilities. The
interest element is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance
of the obligation for each accounting period.
Assets held under other leases (operating
leases) are not recognised in the statement of
financial position. Payments made under the
lease are charged to the statement of income
in equal instalments over the accounting periods covered by the lease term, except where
an alternative basis is more representative of
the pattern of benefits to be derived from the
leased assets. Lease incentives received are
recognised in the statement of income as an
integral part of the aggregate net lease payments made. Contingent rentals are charged
to the statement of income in the accounting
period in which they are incurred.

14 Intangible
assets
Accounting policies
(i) Goodwill
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, an interest
in a joint venture or an associate or an interest in a joint arrangement that comprises a
business, the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities of the acquired business

Creating value / Annual report 2016

(or interest in a business) are recognised at
their fair values unless the fair values cannot
be measured reliably. Where the fair values of
assumed contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably, no liability is recognised but the
contingent liability is disclosed in the same
manner as for other contingent liabilities.
Goodwill arises when the cost of acquisition
exceeds the fair value of the Group’s interest
in the net fair value of identifiable net assets
acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. For this purpose,
goodwill arising on a business combination
is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit from the acquisition and any
impairment loss recognised is not reversed
even where circumstances indicate a recovery
in value.

257

When the fair value of the Group’s share of
identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the
cost of acquisition, the difference is recognised immediately in the statement of income.
In respect of associates or joint ventures, the
carrying amount of goodwill is included in the
carrying amount of the interest in the associate and joint venture and the investment as
a whole is tested for impairment whenever
there is objective evidence of impairment. Any
impairment loss is allocated to the carrying
amount of the interest in the associate and
joint venture.

(ii) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific
or technical knowledge and understanding, is
recognised in the statement of income when
incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design
for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development
expenditure is capitalised only if development
costs can be measured reliably, the product or
process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable
and the Group intends to and has sufficient
resources to complete development and to use
or sell the asset. The expenditure capitalised
includes the cost of materials, direct labour

and overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended
use and capitalised borrowing costs. Other
development expenditure is recognised in the
statement of income when incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses.

(iii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by
the Group, which have finite useful lives, are
measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only
when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which
it relates. All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and
brands, is recognised in the statement of income when incurred.

(v) Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in the statement of
income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other
than goodwill, from the date that they are
available for use. The estimated useful lives
are as follows:
 oftware
s
contracts, acquired in
business combinations

5 years;
2-8 years.

The amortisation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial
year end and adjusted if appropriate.

The amortisation charge is included in cost of
sales in the consolidated statement of income.
Goodwill recognised in these consolidated financial statements initially arose on the formation of the Group in 2000 and the acquisition of a 25% additional interest in the Group
by its controlling shareholder in 2003. The
amount of goodwill was principally increased
in 2007 as a result of the acquisition of certain
businesses of SUAL Partners and Glencore.

(a) Impairment testing of goodwill and
other intangible assets
For the purposes of impairment testing, the
entire amount of goodwill is allocated to the
aluminium segment of the Group’s operations.
The aluminium segment represents the lowest
level within the Group at which the goodwill is
monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount represents value in
use as determined by discounting the future
cash flows generated from the continuing use
of the plants within the Group’s aluminium
segment.

At 31 December 2016, management analysed
changes in the economic environment and developments in the aluminium industry and the
Group’s operations since 31 December 2015
and performed an impairment test for goodwill at 31 December 2016 using the following assumptions to determine the recoverable
amount of the segment:
otal production was estimated based
T
on average sustainable production levels of 3.7 million metric tonnes of primary aluminium, of 7.8 million metric
tonnes of alumina and of 12.0 million
metric tonnes of bauxite. Bauxite and
alumina will be used primarily internally
for production of primary aluminium;
Sales prices were based on the long-term
aluminium price outlook derived from
available industry and market sources
at USD1,673 per tonne for primary aluminium in 2017, USD1,703 in 2018,
USD1,726 in 2019, USD1,789 in 2020,
USD1,911 in 2021. Operating costs were
projected based on the historical performance adjusted for inflation;

Similar considerations to those described
above in respect of assessing the recoverable
amount of property, plant and equipment apply to goodwill.

Inflation of 4.4% – 5.4% in RUB and
1.3% - 2.2% in USD was assumed in
determining recoverable amounts;
The pre-tax discount rate was estimated

A terminal value was derived following

annual growth rate.
Values assigned to key assumptions and estimates used to measure the units’ recoverable amount was based on external sources
of information and historic data. Management
believes that the values assigned to the key
assumptions and estimates represented the
most realistic assessment of future trends.
The results were particularly sensitive to the
following key assumptions:
A 5% reduction in the projected aluminium price level would have resulted in a
decrease in the recoverable amount by
23% and would not lead to an impairment;
A 5% increase in the projected level of
electricity and alumina costs in the aluminium production would have resulted
in a 15% decrease in the recoverable
amount and would not lead to an impairment;
A 1% increase in the discount rate would
have resulted in a 8% decrease in the
recoverable amount and would not lead
to an impairment.
Based on results of impairment testing of goodwill, management concluded that no impairment should be recorded in the consolidated
financial statements as at 31 December 2016.
At 31 December 2015, management analysed
changes in the economic environment and developments in the aluminium industry and the
Group’s operations since 31 December 2014
and performed an impairment test for goodwill at 31 December 2015 using the following assumptions to determine the recoverable
amount of the segment:

financial statements as at 31 December 2015.

15 Interests in
associates and
joint ventures
Accounting policies
An associate is an entity in which the Group
or Company has significant influence, but not
control or joint control, over its management,
including participation in the financial and operating policy decisions.
A joint venture is an arrangement whereby the
Group or Company and other parties contractually agree to share control of the arrangement, and have rights to the net assets of the
arrangement.
An investment in an associate or a joint venture is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method,
unless it is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified
as held for sale). Under the equity method,
the investment is initially recorded at cost,
adjusted for any excess of the Group’s share
of the acquisition-date fair values of the investee’s identifiable net assets over the cost
of the investment (if any). Thereafter, the investment is adjusted for the post acquisition
change in the Group’s share of the investee’s
net assets and any impairment loss relating
to the investment. Any acquisition-date excess over cost, the Group’s share of the postacquisition, post-tax results of the investees
and any impairment losses for the year are
recognised in the consolidated statement of
profit or loss, whereas the Group’s share of
the post-acquisition post-tax items of the investees’ other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of other
comprehensive income.

262

When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its
interest in the associate or the joint venture,
the Group’s interest is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.
Unrealised profits and losses resulting from
transactions between the Group and its associates and joint venture are eliminated to
the extent of the group’s interest in the investee, except where unrealised losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred, in which case they are recognised
immediately in profit or loss.
In accordance with the Group’s accounting
policies, each investment in an associate or
joint venture is evaluated every reporting period to determine whether there are any indications of impairment after application of the
equity method of accounting. If any such indication exists, a formal estimate of recoverable amount is performed and an impairment
loss recognised to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an investment in
an associate or joint venture is measured at
the higher of fair value less costs to sell and
value in use.
Similar considerations to those described
above in respect of assessing the recoverable
amount of property, plant and equipment apply to investments in associates or joint venture. In addition to the considerations described above the Group may also assess the
estimated future cash flows expected to arise
from dividends to be received from the investment, if such information is available and considered reliable.

(a) PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel
The Group’s investment in Norilsk Nickel is
accounted for using equity method and the
carrying value as at 31 December 2016 and
31 December 2015 amounted USD3,592 million and USD2,776 million, respectively. The
market value amounted USD7,348 million and
USD5,542 million as at 31 December 2016 and
31 December 2015, respectively, and is determined by multiplying the quoted bid price per

(b) Queensland Alumina Limited (“QAL”)
The carrying value of the Group’s investment
in Queensland Alumina Limited as at both
31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015
amounted to USD nil million.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

The recoverable amount of investment in
Queensland Alumina Limited as at 31 December 2015 was determined by discounting the
expected future net cash flows of the cash
generating unit and applying the share of
Group’s ownership to the resulting figure. The
pre-tax discount rate applied to discount the
cash flows was 11.0%, estimated in nominal
terms based on an industry weighted average
cost of capital. The recoverable amount of the
cash generating unit was particularly sensitive
to changes in forecast alumina prices, foreign
exchange rates, applicable discount rate.
The Group recognised its share of impairment
losses in Queensland Alumina Limited for the
year ended 31 December 2015 to the extent
of its investment in the entity in the amount of
USD283 million and made the necessary adjustment to the carrying value of the investment which was written down to USD nil million.

(c) BEMO project
The carrying value of the Group’s investment
in BEMO project as at 31 December 2016 and
31 December 2015 amounted USD436 million
and USD329 million, respectively.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the
BEMO project was separated into two cash
generating units – the Boguchansky Aluminium Smelter (“BoAZ’) and the Boguchansky
Hydro Power Plant (“BoGES”). The recoverable
amount was determined by discounting the
expected future net cash flows of each cash
generating unit.
At 31 December 2016 management has not
identified any impairment indicators relating

to the Group’s investment in BoGES and as a
result no detailed impairment testing was performed in relation to this investment. Results
of impairment testing of BoAZ investment for
the year ended 31 December 2016 showed
that investment in BoAZ is fully impaired and
no reversal of previously recorded impairment
was identified by management.
At 31 December 2016, accumulated losses of
USD550 million (2015: USD357 million) related to impairment charges at BoAZ have not
been recognised because the Group’s investment has already been fully written down to
USD nil million.
At 31 December 2015, management has performed impairment testing for its investments
in BoGES and BoAZ as the market conditions
remained challenging and volatile.
The pre-tax discount rates applied to discount
the cash flows for BoAZ and BoGES were
16.5% and 18.9%, respectively, estimated in
nominal terms based on an industry weighted
average cost of capital.
The recoverable amounts of the two cash
generating units are particularly sensitive to
changes in forecast aluminium and electricity
prices, foreign exchange rates, applicable discount rates and, in respect to BoAZ, the forecast period to reach full production capacity.
The Group recognised its share of reversal of
impairment losses in BoGES and made the
necessary adjustment to the carrying value
of investment for the year ended 31 December 2015. The Group’s share of gains related
to BoGES was recognized in the amount of
USD143 million.

16 Inventories
Accounting policies
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost
or net realisable value. Net realisable value
is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less the estimated costs of
completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is determined under
the weighted average cost method, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the
inventories, production or conversion costs
and other costs incurred in bringing them to
their existing location and condition. In the
case of manufactured inventories and work in
progress, cost includes an appropriate share
of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.

The production costs include mining and concentrating costs, smelting, treatment and refining costs, other cash costs and depreciation
and amortisation of operating assets.
The Group recognises write-downs of inventories based on an assessment of the net realisable value of the inventories. A write-down
is applied to the inventories where events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the net
realisable value is less than cost. The determination of net realisable value requires the
use of judgement and estimates. Where the
expectation is different from the original estimates, such difference will impact the carrying
value of the inventories and the write-down
of inventories charged to the statement of income in the periods in which such estimate
has been changed.

17 Non-derivative
financial
instruments

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities at initial recognition of three months or less that are
subject to insignificant risk of changes in their
fair values, and are used by the Group in the
management of its short-term commitments.

Accounting policies

Subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative financial instruments are measured as follows:

Non-derivative financial instruments comprise
investments in securities, trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments and tax assets), cash and cash equivalents, loans and
borrowings and trade and other payables (excluding advances received and tax liabilities).
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly
attributable transaction costs.
A financial instrument is recognised when the
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are
derecognised if the Group’s contractual rights
to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if the Group transfers the financial asset to another party without retaining control
or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the
Group’s obligations specified in the contract
expire or are discharged or cancelled.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and
the net amount presented in the statement of
financial position when, and only when, the
Group has a legal right to offset the amounts
and intends either to settle on a net basis or
to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

rade and other receivables and other
T
non-derivative financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
rade and other payables and other
T
non-derivative financial liabilities subsequent to initial recognition, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
A financial asset not carried at fair value
through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is
any objective evidence that it is impaired. A
financial asset is considered to be impaired if
objective evidence indicates that one or more
events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset occurred
after the initial recognition of that asset and
the impact can be estimated reliably.

267

Objective evidence that financial assets (including equity securities) are impaired can include default or delinquency by a debtor, restructuring of an amount due to the Group on
terms that the Group would not consider otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will
enter bankruptcy and the disappearance of an
active market for a security. In addition, for an
investment in an equity security, a significant
or prolonged decline in its fair value below its
cost is objective evidence of impairment.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated
as the difference between its carrying amount
and the present value of the estimated future
cash flows discounted at the original effective
interest rate.
Individually significant financial assets are
tested for impairment on an individual basis.
The remaining financial assets are assessed
collectively in groups that share similar credit
risk characteristics.

268

All impairment losses are recognised in the
statement of income.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
For financial assets measured at amortised
cost, the reversal is recognised in the statement of income.
Impairment losses for trade receivables included within trade and other receivables
whose recovery is considered doubtful but not
remote are recorded using an allowance account. When the Group is satisfied that recovery is remote, the amount considered irrecoverable is written off against trade receivables
directly and any amounts held in the allowance account relating to that receivable are
reversed. Subsequent recoveries of amounts
previously charged to the allowance account
are reversed against the allowance account.
Other changes in the allowance account and
subsequent recoveries of amounts previously
written off directly are recognised in the statement of income.

All of the trade and other receivables are expected to be settled or recognised as an expense
within one year or are repayable on demand.
The specific allowance for doubtful trade and
other receivables and the impairment loss reversal of trade and other receivables during
the year ended 31 December 2016 amounted
USD6 million and USD11 million, respectively (the specific allowance for doubtful trade
and other receivables and the uncollectible
amount of trade and other receivables written
off during the year ended 31 December 2015
amounted USD8 million and USD13 million,
respectively).

There are no pledged trade receivables under existing secure loans from related parties
at 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015:
USD68 million).

(i) Ageing analysis
Included in trade and other receivables are trade receivables (net of allowance for doubtful
debts) with the following ageing analysis as of the reporting dates:

Aging analysis is performed based on number
of days receivable is overdue. Trade receivables are on average due within 60 days from
the date of billing. The receivables that are
neither past due nor impaired (i.e. current)
relate to a wide range of customers for whom
there was no recent history of default.

270

Receivables that were past due but not impaired relate to a number of customers that
have a good track record with the Group.
Based on past experience, management believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of these balances as there has
not been a significant change in credit quality
and the balances are still considered fully recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. Further details of the
Group’s credit policy are set out in note 22(e).

Creating value / Annual report 2016

(ii) Impairment of trade receivables
Impairment losses in respect of trade receivables are recorded using an allowance account unless the Group is satisfied that recovery of the amount is remote, in which case the impairment
loss is written off against trade receivables directly.
The movement in the allowance for doubtful debts during the year, including both specific and
collective loss components, is as follows:

As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, the Group’s trade receivables of USD14 million and USD25 million, respectively, were individually determined to be impaired. Management
assessed that the receivables were not expected to be recovered. Consequently, specific allowances for doubtful debts were recognised.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

no additional employee expense in relation to
the share based plans.

(c) Other reserves
The acquisition of RUSAL Limited by the Company has been accounted for as a non-substantive acquisition. The consolidated share
capital and share premium represent only the
share capital and share premium of the Company and the share capital and other paid in
capital of RUSAL Limited prior to the acquisition has been included in other reserves.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

In addition, other reserves include the cumulative unrealised actuarial gains and losses on
the Group’s defined post retirement benefit
plans, the effective portion of the accumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedges and the Group’s share of other comprehensive income of associates.

(d) Distributions
In accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 (the “Law”), the Company
may make distributions at any time in such
amounts as are determined by the Company
out of the assets of the Company other than
the capital redemption reserves and nominal
capital accounts, provided that the directors
of the Company make a solvency statement
in accordance with that Law of Jersey at the

20 Provisions
Accounting policies
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount
is recognised as finance costs.

(a) Pension liabilities
Group subsidiaries in the Russian
Federation
The Group voluntarily provides long-term and
post-employment benefits to its former and
existing employees including death-in-service,
jubilee, lump sum upon retirement, material
support for pensioners and death-in-pension
benefits. Furthermore, the Group provides
regular social support payments to some of its
veterans of World War II.
The above employee benefit programs are of
a defined benefit nature. The Group finances
these programs on a pay-as-you-go basis, so
plan assets are equal to zero.

Group subsidiaries in Ukraine
Due to legal requirements, the Ukrainian subsidiaries are responsible for partial financing
of the state hardship pensions for those of its
employees who worked, or still work, under
severe and hazardous labour conditions (hardship early retirement pensions). These pensions are paid until the recipient reaches the
age of entitlement to the State old age pension (55-60 years for female (dependent on
year of birth) and 60 years for male employees). In Ukraine, the Group also voluntarily
provides long-term and post-employment
benefits to its employees including death-inservice, lump sum benefits upon retirement
and death-in-pension benefits.
The above employee benefit programs are of
a defined benefit nature. The Group finances
these programs on a pay-as-you-go basis, so
plan assets are equal to zero.

282

Group subsidiaries outside the Russian
Federation and Ukraine
At its Guinean and Nigerian entities the Group
provides a death-in-service benefit and lumpsum benefits upon disability and old-age retirement.
At its Guyana subsidiary, the Group provides a
death-in-service benefit.
At its Italian subsidiary (Eurallumina) the
Group only provides lump sum benefits upon
retirement, which relate to service up to 1
January 2007.
In Sweden (Kubikenborg Aluminium AB), the
Group provides defined benefit lifelong and
temporary pension benefits. The lifelong benefits are dependent on the past service and
average salary level of the employee, with an
accrual rate that depends on the salary bracket the employee is in. The liability relates only
to benefits accrued before 1 January 2004.
The number of employees in all jurisdictions
eligible for the plans as at 31 December 2016
and 2015 was 56,611 and 57,501, respectively. The number of pensioners in all jurisdictions as at 31 December 2016 and 2015 was
45,915 and 46,626, respectively.
The Group expects to pay under the defined
benefit retirement plans an amount of USD5
million during the 12 month period beginning
on 1 January 2017.

Actuarial valuation of pension liabilities
The actuarial valuation of the Group and the portion of the Group funds specifically designated
for the Group’s employees were completed by a
qualified actuary, Robert van Leeuwen AAG, as
at 31 December 2016, using the projected unit
credit method as stipulated by IAS 19.

As at 31 December 2016 and 31 December
2015 the Group’s obligations were fully uncovered as the Group has only wholly unfunded
plans, so the Group has no schemes with any
plan assets.

(b) Site restoration
The mining, refining and smelting activities
of the Group can give rise to obligations for
site restoration and rehabilitation. Restoration
and rehabilitation works can include facility
decommissioning and dismantling, removal or
treatment of waste materials, land rehabilitation, and site restoration. The extent of work
required and the associated costs are dependent on the requirements of law and the interpretations of the relevant authorities.
The Group provides for site restoration obligations when there is a specific legal or constructive obligation for mine reclamation,
landfill closure (primarily comprising red mud
basin disposal sites) or specific lease restoration requirements. The Group does not record
any obligations with respect to decommissioning of its refining or smelting facilities and restoration and rehabilitation of the surrounding
areas unless there is a specific plan to discontinue operations at a facility. This is because any significant costs in connection with
decommissioning of refining or smelting facilities and restoration and rehabilitation of the
surrounding areas would be incurred no earlier than when the facility is closed and the facilities are currently expected to operate over
a term in excess of 50-100 years due to the
perpetual nature of the refineries and smelters
and continuous maintenance and upgrade programs resulting in the fair values of any such
liabilities being negligible.
Costs included in the provision encompass obligated and reasonably estimable restoration
and rehabilitation activities expected to occur progressively over the life of the operation
and at the time of closure in connection with
disturbances at the reporting date. Routine
operating costs that may impact the ultimate
restoration and rehabilitation activities, such
as waste material handling conducted as an
integral part of a mining or production process, are not included in the provision. Costs
arising from unforeseen circumstances, such
as the contamination caused by unplanned
discharges, are recognised as an expense and
liability when the event gives rise to an obligation which is probable and capable of reliable
estimation.
284

Restoration and rehabilitation provisions are
measured at the expected value of future cash
flows, discounted to their present value and
determined according to the probability of alternative estimates of cash flows occurring for
each operation. Discount rates used are specific to the country in which the operation is
located. Significant judgements and estimates
are involved in forming expectations of future
activities and the amount and timing of the
associated cash flows. Those expectations are
formed based on existing environmental and
regulatory requirements.
When provisions for restoration and rehabilitation are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset, representing
part of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation. The capitalised
cost of restoration and rehabilitation activities
is amortised over the estimated economic life
of the operation on a units of production or
straight-line basis. The value of the provision is
progressively increased over time as the effect
of discounting unwinds, creating an expense
recognised as part of finance expenses.
Restoration and rehabilitation provisions are
also adjusted for changes in estimates. Those
adjustments are accounted for as a change
in the corresponding capitalised cost, except
where a reduction in the provision is greater
than the unamortised capitalised cost, in which
case the capitalised cost is reduced to nil and
the remaining adjustment is recognised in the
statement of income. Changes to the capitalised cost result in an adjustment to future
amortisation charges. Adjustments to the estimated amount and timing of future restoration
and rehabilitation cash flows are a normal occurrence in light of the significant judgements
and estimates involved. Factors influencing
those changes include revisions to estimated
reserves, resources and lives of operations;
developments in technology; regulatory requirements and environmental management
strategies; changes in the estimated costs of
anticipated activities, including the effects of
inflation and movements in foreign exchange
rates; and movements in general interest rates
affecting the discount rate applied.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

The site restoration provision recorded in these consolidated financial statements relates primarily to mine reclamation and red mud basin disposal sites at alumina refineries and is estimated by discounting the risk-adjusted expected expenditure to its present value based on the

At each reporting date the Directors have assessed the provisions for site restoration and
environmental matters and concluded that the
provisions and disclosures are adequate.

(c) Provisions for legal claims
In the normal course of business the Group
may be involved in legal proceedings. Where
management considers that it is more likely
than not that proceedings will result in the
Group compensating third parties a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the
amount expected to be paid. Where management considers that it is more likely than not
that proceedings will not result in the Group
compensating third parties or where, in rare
circumstances, it is not considered possible to
provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of the
amount expected to be paid, no provision is
made for any potential liability under the litigation but the circumstances and uncertainties
involved are disclosed as contingent liabilities.
The assessment of the likely outcome of legal

Creating value / Annual report 2016

proceedings and the amount of any potential
liability involves significant judgement. As law
and regulations in many of the countries in
which the Group operates are continuing to
evolve, particularly in the areas of taxation,
sub-soil rights and protection of the environment, uncertainties regarding litigation and
regulation are greater than those typically
found in countries with more developed legal
and regulatory frameworks.
As at 31 December 2016, there were several claims filed against the Group’s subsidiaries contesting breaches of contract terms and
non-payment of existing obligations. Management has reviewed the circumstances and
estimated that there are no amounts with
a probable outflow related to these claims
(31 December 2015: USD13 million). The
amount of claims, where management assesses outflow as possible approximates USD60
million (31 December 2015: USD37 million).
At each reporting date the Directors have assessed the provisions for litigation and claims
and concluded that the provisions and disclosures are adequate.

285

(d) Tax provisions
The Group’s accounting policy for taxation requires management’s judgement in assessing whether deferred tax assets and certain
deferred tax liabilities are recognised in the
statement of financial position. Deferred tax
assets, including those arising from carried
forward tax losses, capital losses and temporary differences, are recognised only where it
is considered more likely than not that they
will be recovered, which is dependent on the
generation of sufficient future taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary
differences in investments, caused principally
by retained earnings held in foreign tax jurisdictions, are recognised unless repatriation of
retained earnings can be controlled and is not
expected to occur in the foreseeable future.
Assumptions about the generation of future
taxable profits and repatriation of retained
earnings depend on management’s estimates
of future cash flows. These depend on estimates of future production and sales volumes,
commodity prices, reserves, operating costs,
restoration and rehabilitation costs, capital
expenditure, dividends and other capital management transactions. Assumptions are also
required about the application of income tax
legislation. These estimates and assumptions
are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence there
is a possibility that changes in circumstances
will alter expectations, which may impact the
amount of deferred tax assets and deferred
tax liabilities recognised on the statement of
financial position and the amount of other tax
losses and temporary differences not yet recognised. In such circumstances, some or all
of the carrying amount of recognised deferred
tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a corresponding credit or
charge to the statement of income.

286

The Group generally provides for current tax
based on positions taken (or expected to be
taken) in its tax returns. Where it is more likely than not that upon examination by the tax
authorities of the positions taken by the Group
additional tax will be payable, the Group provides for its best estimate of the amount expected to be paid (including any interest and/
or penalties) as part of the tax charge.
At each reporting date the Directors have assessed the provisions for taxation and concluded that the provisions and disclosures are
adequate.

(e) Provision for guarantees
Where the Group enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of
other companies, controlled by the beneficial
shareholder of the Group, the Group considers
these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the
Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes
probable that the Group will be required to
make a payment under the guarantee.
In September 2013 the Group entered into
an agreement with OJSC RusHydro to provide
funds to BoAZ, if the latter is unable to fulfil
its obligations under its credit facility with GK
Vnesheconombank (“VEB”). This agreement
represents a surety for the increased credit
limit obtained for the financing of BoAZ. The
aggregate exposure under the agreement is
limited to RUB16.8 billion (31 December 2016
and 2015 USD277 and USD231 million, respectively) and is split between the Group and
OJSC RusHydro in equal proportion.
During 2016 USD100 million of provision previously recognised was reversed due to fact
that maturity of the initial loan agreement between BoAZ and VEB was extended from 2027
to 2030 accordingly shifting the date principal repayments commence and the fact that
BoGES will continue to support BoAZ in settling its liabilities under the credit facility including principal and interest repayments.

21 Derivative
financial assets/
liabilities
Accounting policies
The Group enters, from time to time, into various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
Embedded derivatives are separated from the
host contract and accounted for separately if
the economic characteristics and risks of the
host contract and the embedded derivative are
not closely related, a separate instrument with
the same terms as the embedded derivative
would meet the definition of a derivative and
the combined instrument is not measured at
fair value through profit or loss.
On initial designation of the derivative as a
hedging instrument, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging
instrument and hedged item, including the
risk management objectives and strategy in
undertaking the hedge transaction and the
hedged risk, together with the methods that
will be used to assess the effectiveness of the
hedging relationship. The Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge
relationship as well as on an ongoing basis,
of whether the hedging instruments are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the
changes in the fair value or cash flows of the
respective hedged items attributable to the
hedged risk, and whether the actual results of
each hedge are within a range of 80% - 125%.
For a cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction should be highly probable
to occur and should present an exposure to
variation in cash flows that ultimately could
affect reported profit or loss.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair
value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in the statement of income when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

The measurement of fair value of derivative
financial instruments, including embedded derivatives, is based on quoted market prices.
Where no price information is available from
a quoted market source, alternative market
mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the
Group’s views on relevant future prices, net of
valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such
estimates. Changes in the fair value therein
are accounted for as described below.
When a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability
in cash flows attributable to a particular risk
associated with a recognised asset or liability
or a highly probable forecast transaction that
could affect profit or loss, the effective portion
of changes in the fair value of the derivative is
recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income and presented in the hedging reserve
in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in
the fair value of a derivative is recognised in
the statement of income.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the amount accumulated in equity is included in the carrying amount of the asset
when the asset is recognised. In other cases,
the amount accumulated in equity is reclassified to the statement of income in the same
period that the hedged item affects profit
or loss. If the hedging instrument no longer
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or
the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the
forecast transaction is no longer expected to
occur, then the balance in equity is reclassified
to the statement of income.
Changes in the fair value of separated embedded derivatives and derivative financial instruments not designated for hedge accounting
are recognised immediately in the statement
of income.

Derivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair value at each reporting date. Fair
value is estimated in accordance with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy based on management estimates and consensus economic forecasts of relevant future prices, net of valuation
allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates. The
Group’s policy is to recognise transfers between levels of fair value hierarchy as at the date
of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. The following significant assumptions were used in estimating derivative instruments:

During the year 2016 there have been no
changes in valuation techniques used to calculate the derivative financial instruments compared to prior year.
Management believes that the values assigned to
the key assumptions and estimates represented
the most realistic assessment of future trends.
The results for the derivative instruments are
not particularly sensitive to any factors other
than the assumptions disclosed above.

Cross-currency and interest rate swaps
Interest rate and cross-currency swaps in relation to the floating rate and ruble credit facilities matured in September and November
2016, respectively, and were settled in full.

Petroleum coke supply contracts and other
raw materials
In May and September 2011, the Group entered into long-term petroleum coke supply
contracts where the price of coke is determined
with reference to the LME aluminium price and
the Brent oil price. The strike price for aluminium is set at USD2,403.45 per tonne and
USD2,497.72 per tonne, respectively, while
the strike price for oil is set at USD61.10 per
barrel and USD111.89 per barrel, respectively.
In May 2014, the Group entered into longterm petroleum coke supply contract where
the price of coke is determined with reference to the LME aluminium price and average monthly aluminium quotations, namely of
Aluminum MW US Transaction premium, MB
Aluminium Premium Rotterdam Low - High»
and Aluminum CIF Japan premium. The strike
price for aluminium is set at USD1,809.65 per
tonne while the strike aluminium premium
quotations for US, Europe and Japan are set at
USD403.96 per tonne, USD313.30 per tonne
and USD366.00 per tonne, respectively.
In November 2015, the Group entered into
long-term pitch supply contract where the
price of pitch is determined with reference to
the LME aluminium price. The strike price for
aluminium is set at USD1,508 per tonne.

22 Financial risk
management and
fair values
(a) Fair values
Management believes that the fair values of
short-term financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amounts.
The methods used to estimate the fair values
of the financial instruments are as follows:
Trade and other receivables, cash and
cash equivalents, current loans and borrowings and trade and other payables:
the carrying amounts approximate fair value
because of the short maturity period of the
instruments.
Long-term loans and borrowings, other
non-current liabilities: the fair values of
other non-current liabilities are based on the
present value of the anticipated cash flows
and approximate carrying value, other than
bonds issued.

The following table presents the fair value of
Group’s financial instruments measured at the
end of the reporting period on a recurring basis, categorised into the three-level fair value
hierarchy as defined by IFRS 13, Fair value
measurement. The level into which a fair value
measurement is classified is determined with
reference to the observability and significance
of the inputs used in the valuation technique
as follows:
 evel 1 valuations: Fair value measured
L
using only Level 1 inputs i.e. unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;
L evel 2 valuations: Fair value measured using Level 2 inputs i.e. observable inputs which fail to meet Level 1,
and not using significant unobservable
inputs. Unobservable inputs are inputs
for which market data are not available;
 evel 3 valuations: Fair value measured
L
using significant unobservable inputs.

Derivatives: the fair value of derivative financial instruments, including embedded derivatives, is based on quoted market prices.
Where no price information is available from
a quoted market source, alternative market
mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the
Group’s views on relevant future prices, net of
valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such
estimates. Option-based derivatives are valued using Black-Scholes models and MonteCarlo simulations. The derivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair value at
each reporting date.

(b) Financial risk management
objectives and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments
comprise bank loans and trade payables. The
main purpose of these financial instruments
is to raise finance for the Group’s operations.
The Group has various financial assets such as
trade receivables and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are cash flow interest rate
risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and
credit risk. Management reviews and agrees
policies for managing each of these risks which
are summarised below.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of
the Group’s risk management framework. The
Board has established a risk management
group within its Department of Internal Control, which is responsible for developing and
monitoring the Group’s risk management policies. The Department reports regularly to the
Board of Directors on its activities.
The Group’s risk management policies are
established to identify and analyse the risks
faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk
limits and controls, and to monitor risks and
adherence to limits. Risk management policies
and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect
changes in market conditions and the Group’s
activities. The Group, through its training and
management standards and procedures, aims
to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how
management monitors compliance with the
Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk
management framework in relation to the
risks faced by the Group. The Group’s Audit
Committee is assisted in its oversight role by
the Group’s Internal Audit function which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of
risk management controls and procedures,
the results of which are reported to the Audit
Committee.

(c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of
financial instruments. The objective of market
risk management is to manage and control
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising returns.

(i) Commodity price risk
During the years ended 31 December 2016
and 2015, the Group has entered into certain
long term electricity contracts and other commodity derivatives contracts in order to manage its exposure of commodity price risks. Details of the contracts are disclosed in note 21.

(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes
in market interest rates relates primarily to
the Group’s long-term debt obligations with
floating interest rates (refer to note 19). The
Group’s policy is to manage its interest costs
by monitoring changes in interest rates with
respect to its borrowings.

(iii) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on
sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of group entities, primarily USD but also the Russian Ruble,
Ukrainian Hryvna and Euros. The currencies in
which these transactions primarily are denominated are RUB, USD and EUR.
Borrowings are primarily denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated
by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily USD but also RUB and EUR. This provides an economic hedge.

Creating value / Annual report 2016

In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the
Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to
an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary
to address short-term imbalances or entering
into currency swap arrangements.
The Group’s exposure at the reporting date to
foreign currency risk arising from recognised
assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of
the entity to which they relate is set out in
the table below. Differences resulting from the
translation of the financial statements of foreign operations into the Group’s presentation
currency are ignored.

Results of the analysis as presented in the
above tables represent an aggregation of the
instantaneous effects on the Group entities’
profit before taxation and other comprehensive income measured in the respective functional currencies, translated into USD at the
exchange rates ruling at the reporting date for
presentation purposes.
The sensitivity analysis assumes that the
change in foreign exchange rates had been
applied to re-measure those financial instruments held by the Group which expose the
Group to foreign currency risk at the reporting
date. The analysis excludes differences that
would result from the translation of other financial statements of foreign operations into
the Group’s presentation currency. The analysis has been performed on the same basis for
all years presented.

(d) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will
not be able to meet its financial obligations
as they fall due. The group policy is to maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents or
have available funding through an adequate
amount of committed credit facilities to meet
its operating and financial commitments.
The following tables show the remaining contractual maturities at the reporting date of
the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities,
which are based on contractual undiscounted
cash flows (including interest payment computed using contractual rates, or if floating, based
on rates current at the reporting date) and the
earliest the Group can be required to pay.

At 31 December 2016 the Group’s guarantee in respect of credit arrangement between
BoAZ and VEB (note 20(e)) is presented as
contingent liability and included at maximum
exposure for the Group in the liquidity risk disclosure above.

(e) Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy
that all customers who wish to trade on credit
terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The majority of the Group’s third party
trade receivables represent balances with the
world’s leading international corporations operating in the metals industry. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing
basis with the result that the Group’s exposure
to bad debts is not significant. Goods are normally sold subject to retention of title clauses,
so that in the event of non-payment the Group
may have a secured claim. The Group does not
require collateral in respect of trade and other
receivables. The details of impairment of trade

298

and other receivables are disclosed in note 17.
The extent of the Group’s credit exposure is
represented by the aggregate balance of financial assets and financial guarantees given.
At 31 December 2016 and 2015, the Group
has certain concentrations of credit risk as
7.5% and 7.5% of the total trade receivables
were due from the Group’s largest customer
and 19.5% and 8.9% of the total trade receivables were due from the Group’s five largest
customers, respectively (refer to note 5 for the
disclosure on revenue from largest customer).
With respect to credit risk arising from guarantees, the Group’s policy is to provide financial
guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries,
associates and joint ventures. Management
have derecognised a provision of USD100 million against the Group’s exposure to guarantees (refer to note 20(e)).

Creating value / Annual report 2016

(f) Capital risk management

(g) Master netting or similar agreements

The Group’s objectives when managing capital
are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
returns for shareholders and benefits for other
stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

The Group may enter into sales and purchase
agreements with the same counterparty in
the normal course of business. The related
amount receivable and payable do not always
meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position. This is because the
Group may not have any currently legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts,
because the right to offset may be enforceable
only on the occurrence of future events.

The Group manages its capital structure and
makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in
economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the
capital structure, the Group may adjust the
amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares
or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor
and market confidence and to sustain future
development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which
the Group defines as net operating income divided by total shareholders’ equity, excluding
non-controlling interests. The Board of Directors also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.

There are no financial instruments that meet
the offsetting criteria in the statement of financial position for the year ended 31 December 2016. There are no recognised financial
instruments that do not meet some or all of
the offsetting criteria that are included within
financial assets and liabilities of the Group as
at 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015:
USD13 million).

The Board seeks to maintain a balance between higher returns that might be possible
with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound
capital position.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
The Company and its subsidiaries were subject
to externally imposed capital requirements in
the both years presented in these consolidated financial statements.

23 Commitments
(a) Capital commitments
The Group has entered into contracts that result in contractual obligations primarily relating to various construction and capital repair
works. The commitments at 31 December
2016 and 31 December 2015 approximated
USD157 million and USD169 million, respectively. These commitments are due over a
number of years.

(b) Purchase commitments
Commitments with third parties for purchases
of alumina, bauxite, other raw materials and
other purchases in 2017-2034 under supply
agreements are estimated from USD3,156
million to USD4,089 million at 31 December
2016 (31 December 2015: USD3,793 million
to USD4,912 million) depending on the actual
purchase volumes and applicable prices.
Commitments with related parties – companies
under common control for purchases of alumina in 2017 under supply agreements are estimated at USD nil million at 31 December 2016
(31 December 2015: USD110 million). Commitments with a related party - joint venture
for purchases of primary aluminium and alloys
in 2017-2030 under supply agreements are
estimated from USD5,748 million to USD7,127
million (31 December 2015: USD5,512 million
to USD6,836 million) depending on the actual
purchase volumes and applicable prices.

(c) Sale commitments
Commitments with third parties for sales of
alumina and other raw materials in 20172034 are estimated from USD806 million to
USD1,445 million at 31 December 2016 (31
December 2015: from USD793 million to
USD1,349 million) and will be settled at market prices at the date of delivery. Commitments with related parties for sales of alumina
in 2017-2019 approximated from USD546 million to USD680 million at 31 December 2016
(31 December 2015: from USD504 million to
USD1,046 million).
Commitments with related parties for sales
of primary aluminium and alloys in 20172030 are estimated from USD4,450 million to
USD4,618 million at 31 December 2016 (31
December 2015: from USD4,441 million to
USD5,016 million). Commitments with third
parties for sales of primary aluminium and alloys at 31 December 2016 are estimated to
range from USD941 million to USD1,252 million (31 December 2015: from USD307 million
to USD654 million).

(e) Social commitments

(b) Environmental contingencies

The Group contributes to the maintenance and
upkeep of the local infrastructure and the welfare of its employees, including contributions
toward the development and maintenance of
housing, hospitals, transport services, recreation and other social needs of the regions
of the Russian Federation where the Group’s
production entities are located. The funding of
such assistance is periodically determined by
management and is appropriately capitalised
or expensed as incurred.

The Group and its predecessor entities have
operated in the Russian Federation, Ukraine,
Jamaica, Guyana, the Republic of Guinea and
the European Union for many years and certain environmental problems have developed.
Governmental authorities are continually considering environmental regulations and their
enforcement and the Group periodically evaluates its obligations related thereto. As obligations are determined, they are recognised
immediately. The outcome of environmental
liabilities under proposed or any future legislation, or as a result of stricter enforcement of
existing legislation, cannot reasonably be estimated. Under current levels of enforcement
of existing legislation, management believes
there are no possible liabilities, which will
have a material adverse effect on the financial
position or the operating results of the Group.
However, the Group anticipates undertaking
significant capital projects to improve its future environmental performance and to bring
it into full compliance with current legislation.

24 Contingencies
(a) Taxation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and
changes, which can occur frequently. Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the
Group may be challenged by the relevant local, regional and federal authorities. Notably
recent developments in the Russian environment suggest that the authorities in this country are becoming more active in seeking to
enforce, through the Russian court system, interpretations of the tax legislation, in particular in relation to the use of certain commercial
trading structures, which may be selective for
particular tax payers and different to the authorities’ previous interpretations or practices.
Different and selective interpretations of tax
regulations by various government authorities
and inconsistent enforcement create further
uncertainties in the taxation environment in
the Russian Federation.
In addition to the amounts of income tax the
Group has provided, there are certain tax positions taken by the Group where it is reasonably possible (though less than 50% likely)
that additional tax may be payable upon examination by the tax authorities or in connection with ongoing disputes with tax authorities.
The Group’s best estimate of the aggregate
maximum of additional amounts that it is reasonably possible may become payable if these
tax positions were not sustained at 31 December 2016 is USD225 million (31 December
2015: USD237 million).

Creating value / Annual report 2016

(c) Legal contingencies
The Group’s business activities expose it to a
variety of lawsuits and claims which are monitored, assessed and contested on the ongoing
basis. Where management believes that a lawsuit or another claim would result in the outflow of the economic benefits for the Group,
a best estimate of such outflow is included in
provisions in the consolidated financial statements (refer to note 20). As at 31 December
2016 the amount of claims, where management assesses outflow as possible approximates USD60 million (31 December 2015:
USD37 million).

301

In January 2013, the Company received a writ
of summons and statement of claim filed in
the High Court of Justice of the Federal Capital
Territory of Nigeria (Abuja) by plaintiff BFIG
Group Divino Corporation (“BFIG”) against certain subsidiaries of the Company. It is a claim
for damages arising out of the defendants’ alleged tortious interference in the bid process
for the sale of the Nigerian government’s majority stake in the Aluminium Smelter Company of Nigeria (“ALSCON”) and alleged loss
of BFIG’s earnings resulting from its failed bid
for the said stake in ALSCON. BFIG seeks compensatory damages in the amount of USD2.8
billion. In January 2014 the court granted the
Company’s motion to join the Federal Republic
of Nigeria and Attorney General of Nigeria to
the case as co-defendants. The next hearing
is currently scheduled for 22 May 2017. Based
on a preliminary assessment of the claim, the
Company does not expect the case to have
any material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position or its operation as a whole.

302

(d) Risks and concentrations
A description of the Group’s major products
and its principal markets, as well as exposure
to foreign currency risks are provided in note 1
“Background” and note 22 “Financial risk management and fair values”. The price at which
the Group can sell its products is one of the
primary drivers of the Group’s revenue. The
Group’s prices are largely determined by prices set in the international market. The Group’s
future profitability and overall performance is
strongly affected by the price of primary aluminium that is set in the international market.

(e) Insurance
Where the Group enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of
other companies, controlled by the beneficial
shareholder of the Group, the Group considers
these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the
Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes
probable that the Group will be required to
make a payment under the guarantee.

The Group has entered into three categories
of related-party transactions: (i) those entered into on an arm’s length basis, (ii) those
entered into on non-arm’s length terms but
as part of a wider deal resulting from arms’
length negotiations with unrelated third parties, and (iii) transactions unique to the Group
and the counterparty.

Statement of
responsibility for
this Annual Report
I, Vladislav Soloviev, declare, to the best of
