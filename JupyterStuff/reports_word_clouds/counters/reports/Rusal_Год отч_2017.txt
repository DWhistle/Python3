BUSINESS OVERVIEW

WARNING
The information presented in this Annual Report only
reﬂects the Company’s position during the review period
from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017 (the “Review
Period”) pursuant to the requirements of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange of
Hong Kong Limited (the “Listing Rules”) (unless otherwise
speciﬁed). Accordingly, all forward-looking statements,
analyses, reviews, discussions, commentaries and risks
presented in this Annual Report (save for this Warning, the
sub-section headed “Material events since the end of the
year” in the “Management Discussion and Analysis” section and the “Recent Development of the Company” section, and unless otherwise speciﬁed) are based upon the
ﬁnancial information of the Company covering the Review
Period only and not thereafter.
Shareholders and potential investors should be aware that
on 6 April 2018, the Oﬃce of Foreign Assets Control of
the Department of the Treasury of the United States of
America (the “U.S. Treasury”) designated, amongst others, certain persons and certain companies which are controlled or deemed to be controlled by some of these persons to be added to its Specially Designated Nationals List
(the “OFAC Sanctions”). The designated persons/entities
include Mr. Oleg Deripaska, a non-executive director of
the Company, the Company, En+ Group Plc, a Jersey company listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Moscow
Stock Exchange and a shareholder holding 48.13% equity
interest in the Company, B-Finance Ltd., a BVI company,
and Basic Element Limited, a Jersey company, each controlled by Mr. Deripaska, together with certain other companies owned or controlled or deemed to be controlled by
Mr. Deripaska.
A press statement issued by the U.S. Treasury in respect of
the OFAC Sanctions on 6 April 2018 states that: “All assets
subject to U.S. jurisdiction of the designated individuals
and entities, and of any other entities blocked by operation of law as a result of their ownership by a sanctioned
party, are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited
from dealings with them. Additionally, non-U.S. persons
could face sanctions for knowingly facilitating signiﬁcant
transactions for or on behalf of the individuals or entities
blocked today.”

As stated in the announcement of the Company dated
9 April 2018, the Company’s initial assessment is that it
is highly likely that the impact of the OFAC Sanctions on
the Group may be materially adverse to the business and
prospects of the Group. The Company is currently in the
process of conducting further evaluation to assess the
impact of the OFAC Sanctions on the Group and is closely
monitoring the development. Further announcements will
be published by the Company as and when appropriate in
accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules and
applicable laws.
Shareholders and potential investors should be aware that
the information presented in this Annual Report (save for
this Warning, the sub-section headed “Material events
since the end of the year” in the “Management Discussion and Analysis” section and the “Recent Development
of the Company” section, and unless otherwise speciﬁed) does not take into account the OFAC Sanctions or
any potential impact which the OFAC Sanctions may have
on the Company or the Group. Accordingly, the information presented in this Annual Report (save for this Warning, the sub-section headed “Material events since the
end of the year” in the “Management Discussion and
Analysis” section and the “Recent Development of the
Company” section, and unless otherwise speciﬁed),
including but not limited to all forward-looking statements,
analyses, reviews, discussions, commentaries and risks,
does not reﬂect the latest position (ﬁnancial or otherwise)
of the Group. Given the global nature of the business of
the Group, the international politico-economic dimension
of the OFAC Sanctions, and the potential cross-jurisdictional implications of the OFAC Sanctions, this matter is
continually evolving. Shareholders and potential investors
are therefore strongly advised to make reference to the
latest announcements (i.e. announcements issued by the
Company on and after 9 April 2018) issued by the Company before dealing in the Shares.
Shareholders and potential investors should exercise
extreme caution when dealing in the Shares. If in doubt,
they are strongly advised to consult their stockbrokers,
bank managers, solicitors and/or other professional advisers before dealing in the Shares.

SECURED ACCESS TO GREEN, RENEWABLE
ELECTRICITY.

FOCUS ON HIGHER MARGIN DOWNSTREAM
BUSINESS.

Electricity is a key component of the aluminum production process. UC RUSAL’s core smelting operations are
favorably located close to the Siberian hydro power plants
sourcing from them approximately 95% of the Group’s
total electricity needs. The Company has long term agreements with the region’s hydro-power energy suppliers.
Using renewable and environmentally friendly hydro generated electricity, UC RUSAL is targeting the best CO2
footprint in the industry.

UC RUSAL has a diversiﬁed product mix with a strong share
of VAP in the portfolio (1.87 million tonnes per annum out
of 3.96 million tonnes of total sales). The Company targets
to increase the sales of VAP, to up to 60% of total sales by
2021 in particular, through improvements to its smelters
located in Siberia.

CAPTIVE RAW MATERIAL SUPPLIES.
UC RUSAL alumina production capacities are located in
Russia and abroad. These operations cover over approximately 100% of the Group’s total alumina needs.
Our alumina reﬁneries bauxite needs are covered
by up to 70% with supplies from the Group’s bauxite mining operations. Our existing bauxite resource base is sufﬁcient to supply for over 100 years of operations.

EFFICIENT MIDSTREAM, PROPRIETARY R&D
AND INTERNAL EPCM EXPERTISE.
UC RUSAL aluminum smelting operations goes through
regular upgrades. UC RUSAL has developed its own inhouse R&D, design and engineering centers and operates
RA-300, RA-400 and Green Soederberg smelting technologies. A new energy eﬃcient and environmentally friendly
RA-500, RA-550 smelting technology has been designed
and currently RUSAL is testing it, targeting the best energy
eﬃciency yields in the industry.
UC RUSAL is actively developing a groundbreaking
inert anode technology. Introducing this state-of-art technology into the production process will lead to complete
elimination of greenhouse gas and polyaromatic hydrocarbon emissions coupled with 10% cut in operational costs
through reducing anode and energy consumption and over
a 30% cut in Greenﬁeld projects expenditure costs.

COST EFFICIENCY.
The eﬃcient smelting technologies together with low cost
input material and utilities mix secures the Company’s
global leadership on the cost curve.

DIVERSIFIED SALES GEOGRAPHY.
UC RUSAL’s sales mix is represented by a diversiﬁed portfolio of regions. The Company delivers aluminium products to all key Global consuming regions (Europe, USA,
South East Asia) and to the domestic market.

GROWTH POTENTIAL OF THE UC RUSAL
PLATFORM.
The BEMO Project (UC RUSAL and Rushydro JV) includes
the 3,000 megawatt BEMO HPP (the construction of which
was completed in 2014) and Boguchansky aluminium
smelter in the Krasnoyarsk region of Russia. The overall smelter project has a designed capacity of approximately 600 thousand tonnes per annum. Currently the 1st
complex of the smelter was launched and is operating at
capacity of 149 thousand tonnes per annum.

IMPLEMENTING ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES.
UC RUSAL was one of the ﬁrst Russian companies that
joined UN Global Compact. By following its environmental policy and undertaking to regularly review and update
its provisions, the Company is constantly developing and
improving its environmental management system and
implementing its principles at all production facilities. In
2017 UC RUSAL has launched new low carbon aluminium
brand, ALLOW, which features a signiﬁcantly lower carbon footprint – speciﬁc volume of greenhouse emissions
gas as compared to industry average (4t CO2/t Al vs 13.4
CO2/t Al of world average (scope 1 and 2 at the smelter).

C H A I R M A N ’ S STAT E M E N T

CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT
MATTHIAS WARNIG
Chairman of the Board

Dear Shareholders,
2017 was another year of growth for RUSAL. The Company
demonstrated a very solid performance, taking full advantage of positive market trends whilst also a positive year
for future growth. We are currently living in a time where
the world is rapidly changing; digital technologies, artiﬁcial intelligence, internet of things and other attributes
of Industry 4.0 are what will deﬁne the world of tomorrow.
As such, in 2017 we took all these factors into account,
dedicating a signiﬁcant eﬀort towards sharpening our long
term strategy ensuring that RUSAL is well prepared to
capture new growth opportunities and suitably hedged for
any period of uncertainty or volatility as markets evolve.

2017 PERFORMANCE AND SHAREHOLDER
DISTRIBUTIONS
In 2017, the aluminium market environment was highly
favorable for the Company. We delivered strong earnings
and cash ﬂow while maintaining disciplined capital spending and cost controls. The Company met its debt reduction target with further deleveraging remaining one of key
priorities. Importantly, we continued to make progress in

safety performance, with serious incidents and injury rates
falling. The realization of large-scale investment projects
continued according to our scheduled plan, while a number
of new prospective ones also took shape.
Such a robust performance enabled us to approve an
interim dividend of USD299.3 million (USD0.0197 per ordinary share) for 2017, which was paid on 10 October 2017.

OFAC SANCTIONS
On 6 April 2018, the Oﬃce of Foreign Assets Control of
the Department of the Treasury of the United States of
America designated, amongst others, certain persons
and certain companies which are controlled or deemed
to be controlled by some of these persons to be added to
its Specially Designated Nationals List (the “OFAC Sanctions”). The designated persons/entities include Mr. Oleg
Deripaska, a non-executive director of the Company, the
Company, En+, a shareholder holding 48.13% equity interest in the Company, B-Finance Ltd., a BVI company, and
Basic Element, each controlled by Mr. Deripaska, together
with certain other companies owned or controlled or
deemed to be controlled by Mr. Deripaska.

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

As stated in the announcement of the Company dated
9 April 2018, the Company’s initial assessment is that it
is highly likely that the impact of the OFAC Sanctions on
the Group may be materially adverse to the business and
prospects of the Group. The Company is currently in the
process of conducting further evaluation to assess the
impact of the OFAC Sanctions on the Group and is closely
monitoring the development.
Given the global nature of the business of the Group, the
international politico-economic dimension of the OFAC
Sanctions, and the potential cross-jurisdictional implications of the OFAC Sanctions, this matter is continually
evolving. The Company will make further announcements
as and when appropriate in accordance with the Listing
Rules and applicable laws.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

BEMO Project
The BEMO Project involves the construction of
the 3,000 MW Boguchanskaya Hydropower Plant and the
BEMO aluminium smelter in the Krasnoyarsk region in
Siberia, which is expected to produce approximately 600
kt of aluminium per annum.
The construction of the BEMO aluminium smelter
is divided into two stages (each one for 298 kt of aluminium
per annum). The start-up complex of the ﬁrst stage (149 kt
of aluminium per annum, 168 pots) was launched in 2015
and the second stage of BEMO smelter (~300ktpa) is to be
considered with strategic partner RusHydro after completion of the ﬁrst stage and subject to market situation and
availability of project ﬁnancing.
The capital expenditure for the ﬁrst stage of
BEMO aluminium smelter (capacity 298 kt per annum),
incurred and to be incurred, is currently estimated at
approximately USD1,612 million (UC RUSAL’s share of
such capital expenditure is expected to be approximately
USD806 million), of which approximately USD1,453 million
has been incurred as of 31 December 2017 (of which UC
RUSAL’s share amounted to approximately USD726.6 million). Actual capital expenditure for the BEMO aluminium
smelter in 2017 was USD129.48 million (of which UC RUSAL’s share amounted to USD64.74 million).

Taishet
UC RUSAL is investing into new projects:
Aluminium Smelter
The construction of Taishet aluminium smelter originally
commenced in 2006. Due to unfavorable market conditions, RUSAL decided to suspend the project in 2009. Following the evidence of economic recovery and improved
market conditions in 2016, RUSAL’s Board of directors
decided to resume the construction and approved ﬁnancing in the amount of USD72.5 million, for top-priority
works at PC-1 (the ﬁrst line) in the amount of approximately USD39 million for 2017. The project contemplates
the construction of the aluminium smelter with designed
production capacity of approximately 983,600 tonnes of
aluminium per annum in the Irkutsk region in Siberia. The
smelter is divided into two lines: PC-1 (the ﬁrst line) with a
capacity of 428,500 tonnes of aluminium per annum with
352 pots (RA 400) installed and PC-2 (the second line) with
a capacity of 555,100 tonnes of aluminium per annum with
352 pots (RA 550) installed. PC-1 (the ﬁrst line) is expected
to consume 6.4 TWh of electricity per annum while the
smelter operating at full capacity is designed to consume
14.2 TWh of electricity per annum. As at 31 December
2017, UC RUSAL invested USD829 million (excluding VAT)
for both lines.

ALUMINA
The Group owns 9 alumina reﬁneries as at the end of 2017.
Nine of UC RUSAL’s alumina reﬁneries are located in six
countries: Ireland (one plant), Jamaica (one plant), Ukraine
(one plant), Italy (one plant), Russia (four plants) and Guinea
(one plant). In addition, the Company holds a 20% equity
stake in QAL, an alumina reﬁnery located in Australia. Most
of the Group’s reﬁneries have ISO 9001 certiﬁed quality
control systems. Four reﬁneries and QAL have been ISO
14001 certiﬁed for their environmental management and
three reﬁneries have received OHSAS 18001 certiﬁcation
for their health and safety management system.
The Company’s long position in alumina capacity helps to secure suﬃcient supply for the prospective
expansion of the Company’s aluminium production capacity and allows the Company to take advantage of favorable
market conditions through third-party alumina sales.

With energy being a major cost item, all of the
Alumina Division plants were involved in major energy
savings programs during 2017, which allowed for overall speciﬁc energy consumption reduction per 1 tonne
of alumina production from 20.73 GJ in 2016 to 20.33 GJ
in 2017. In addition to that, a number of other important
projects have been implemented to achieve cost savings
and increase competitiveness including:

Windalco. The sands removal project was in its
development and construction stage in 2017.
Major repairs of Turbogenerators #2 and #3
were done in 2017. Decreased alumina output
at Windalco Ewarton was caused by poor bauxite quality, unstable bauxite supply due to rainfalls, and emergency repairs of major equipment.

Achinsk Alumina Reﬁnery. A program of partial
substitution of costly bright coal by the ligneous coal for sintering purposes is ongoing.
Residue disposal area #3 construction project
were completed and commissioned in 2017.

Decreased alumina output at QAL was caused
by poor bauxite quality and emergency repairs
of major equipment.

Urals Alumina Refinery. A capacity expansion program is complete. The construction of
continuous digester module #2 with two new
digester lines completed in 2017. New precipitator tanks commissioned in 2017, increasing capacity to 900 thousand tonnes from 864
thousand tonnes in 2016.
Nikolaev Alumina Refinery. All stages of 1,700
thousand tonnes capacity increasing program
were accomplished in 2017.
Aughinish Alumina Reﬁnery. Numbers of developmental and organizational activities were
deployed for expected Dian-Dian blend, conceptual study was done. New ship loader was
installed and commissioned.

BAUXITE
The Group operates six bauxite mines. UC RUSAL’s bauxite mines are located in four countries: Russia (two mines),
Jamaica (one mine), Guyana (one mine) and Guinea (two
mines and one project). The Company’s long position in
bauxite capacity helps to secure suﬃcient supply for the
prospective expansion of the Company’s alumina production capacity and allows the Company to take advantage
of favorable market conditions through third-party bauxite sales.
In 2017, a complex of capital mining operations
was carried out to open the Verkhne-Schugorskoe ore
body in the volume of 1.380 million m3 in accordance with
the development project.
In 2017 mining equipment renovation project has
started at BCGI.
Intense construction activities regarding development of the new deposit Dian-Dian continued in 2017.
The table below provides an overview of UC RUSAL’s
bauxite mines (including capacity) as at 31 December
2017.

Energy assets
BEMO Project
BEMO HPP is the fourth step of the Angara hydroelectric
power chain, the biggest major hydro-power plant completion project in Russia. Construction of the power plant
was suspended in Soviet times due to the lack of ﬁnancing
and was resumed in May 2006 by UC RUSAL and RusHydro
following the conclusion of their agreement to jointly
implement the BEMO project comprising the BEMO HPP
(the average annual electricity output reaching 17.6 billion kWh) and an aluminium smelter capable of producing
600,000 tonnes of metal per year.

Mining Assets
UC RUSAL’s mining assets comprise 15 mines and
mine complexes, including bauxite mines (the resources of
which are described above), two quartzite mines, one ﬂuorite mine, two coal mines, one nepheline syenite mine and
two limestone mines.
The Company jointly operates the two coal mines
with Samruk-Energo, the energy division of SamrukKazyna under a 50/50 joint venture, Bogatyr Coal LLP. The
long position in alumina capacity is supported by the Company’s bauxite and nepheline syenite resource base.
Bogatyr Coal LLP

The project’s 79 meters high, 2,587 meters long
composite gravity and rock-ﬁll dam was completed at the
end of 2011 and nine 333 MW hydropower units of the
BEMO HPP were put into operation during 2012-2014. The
total installed capacity of all nine hydro-units in operation
amounts to 2,997 MW.
All nine 333 MW turbines and generators were
supplied by OJSC Power Machines, under contracts worth
more than RUB6 billion signed in December 2006 and September 2007, respectively. The turbines for the project are
among the largest ever manufactured in Russia by weight
and dimensions: each runner is 7.86 meters in diameter
and weighs 155.6 tonnes.
The plant has started commercial supplies to the
wholesale electricity and capacity market on 1 December 2012. Since its launch the BEMO HPP has generated
54.012 TWh of electricity. During 2017, the plant has supplied 13.287 TWh to the wholesale electricity and capacity
market.
UC RUSAL’s proportion of capital expenditure
for the BEMO Project is 50%. The total capital expenditure for the BEMO HPP, incurred and to be incurred, is currently estimated to be approximately USD2,116 million1
(UC RUSAL’s share of this capital expenditure is expected
to be approximately USD1,058 million), of which USD2,100
million had been spent as of 31 December 2017 (of which
UC RUSAL’s share amounted to USD1,050 million).

billion tonnes of JORC Proved and Probable Ore Reserves
and has Measured Mineral Resources and Indicated Mineral Resources in aggregate of approximately 2.14 billion
tonnes as at 31 December 2017. Bogatyr Coal LLP generated sales of approximately USD185 million in 2016 and
USD250 million in 2017. Sales are divided approximately as
to one third and two thirds, respectively, between Russian
and Kazakh customers based on the quantities sold.
Investment in Norilsk Nickel
Norilsk Nickel is the world’s largest palladium
producer, the second nickel producer and one of the leading producers of platinum and copper. UC RUSAL held
27.82% shareholding in Norilsk Nickel as at the Latest
Practicable Date.
UC RUSAL’s shareholding in Norilsk Nickel allows
for signiﬁcant diversiﬁcation of earnings, through Norilsk
Nickel’s exposure to PGMs2 and bulk materials, as well as
broadens UC RUSAL’s strategic opportunities. The Company’s objective is to maximize the value of this investment for all shareholders.

All capital expenditure amounts given above for the BEMO project are based on UC RUSAL’s
management accounts and differ from amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial
statements, as the management accounts reflect the latest best estimate of the capital costs
required to complete the project, whereas amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial
statements reflect actual capital commitments as at 31 December 2017. All figures for the

In 2017, Norilsk Nickel produced 217 kt of nickel,
401 kt of copper, 2,780 koz of palladium and 670 koz of
platinum. Compared to 2016, it is to be noted that:
1)

Planned reduction in production of Nickel (-8%)
mostly due to reduction of low-margin processing of third parties feed (for information: production of Nickel from own Russian feed increased

2)

Growth in production of Copper (+11%) mostly
due to processing of concentrate purchased
from Rostec;

3)

Increasing in PGM production (+6% Palladium,
+4% Platinum) mostly due to the processing of
concentrate purchased from Rostec, processing
of work-in-progress material stored at Polar division and decrease of work-in-progress material
in transit due to the completion of downstream
reconﬁguration.

Norilsk Nickel’s metal sales are highly diversiﬁed by (i)
regions: Europe, Asia, North and South America, Russia

Settlement with Interros in relation to Norilsk Nickel
On 10 December 2012, Interros (which holds approximately 30.4% of Norilsk Nickel shares, according to the
Norilsk Nickel’s Annual Report 2016), UC RUSAL (27.82%),
Crispian (4.2%2) and the respective beneﬁcial owners of Interros and Crispian, namely, Mr. Potanin and Mr.
Abramovich, entered into an agreement (the ‘Agreement’)
to improve the existing corporate governance and transparency of the Norilsk Nickel group, to maximize proﬁtability and shareholder value and to settle the disagreements of UC RUSAL and Interros in relation to Norilsk
Nickel Group.

In 2015, Norilsk Nickel’s commitments pertaining to special dividends were fulﬁlled in advance (special
dividends were paid out during 2014-2015, including dividend per Norilsk Nickel’s shareholder resolution resolved
in the annual general meeting on 13 May 2015).
On 5 April 2016 the Company entered into the
side letter among the parties to the Agreement pursuant to which the Agreement was further amended (the
Amendments), among others, to the following eﬀects on
Dividend Policy and Capital Expenditure of Norilsk Nickel:

DIVIDEND POLICY OF NORILSK NICKEL
DIVIDEND POLICY AFTER THE AMENDMENTS
(AS OF 5 APRIL 2016)

DIVIDEND POLICY BEFORE THE AMENDMENTS
(EFFECTIVE SINCE 29 JUNE 2015)

Starting 2017 and each subsequent year,
the annual dividends payable by Norilsk
Nickel shall be determined on the basis of
the ratio of Norilsk Nickel’s Net Debt to
Norilsk Nickel’s EBITDA as of 31 December
of the preceding year as follows:

1) The parties must ensure that annual dividend paid by Norilsk Nickel from 2016 onward
(“Subsequent Agreed Dividend”) shall be in an amount equal to 50% of EBITDA for the year
preceding the year in which the dividends are paid, but no less than USD2 billion and to be
calculated in US Dollars using the Bank of Russia’s exchange rate for the date the board of
directors of Norilsk Nickel passes a resolution on the recommended amount of the dividends.

1) 60% of EBITDA if the ratio is 1.8 and less;
2) 30% of EBITDA if the ratio is 2.2 and
more; and
3) if the ratio falls between 1.8 and 2.2,
the percentage of EBITDA to be paid as
dividends shall be calculated as follows:
X% = 60% — (Net Debt/EBITDA —
1.8)/0.4*30%.
The minimal amount of the annual dividends
payable by Norilsk Nickel in 2017 shall not
be less than USD1.3 billion. In addition,
earnings received by Norilsk Nickel from
the sale of 100% of shares in Norilsk Nickel
Africa (Pty) Limited (reduced by the amount
of expenses associated with the sale and
taxes) shall be paid as a dividend by Norilsk
Nickel in 2017.
Starting 2018, the minimal amount of the
annual dividends payable by Norilsk Nickel
shall not be less than USD1 billion.

2.

According to the NN Annual Report 2016

2) The amount of Subsequent Agreed Dividend can be decreased at the discretion of the
Managing Partner of Norilsk Nickel if the amount of dividends, actually distributed in preceding
period(s) (starting from 2016), exceeds respective EBITDA Dividend (being 50% EBITDA for the
previous year but no less than USD2 billion) — within the amount of such excess.
3) If during any year commercially reasonable opportunity emerges to distribute dividends
more than twice a year and the investors agree with such payment schedule, there is a soft
undertaking of the Managing Partner of Norilsk Nickel to schedule pay-outs of dividends more
frequently than twice a year.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE OF NORILSK NICKEL

GROUP-WIDE INITIATIVES

The capital expenditures and/or expenses to purchase
other non-current assets that can be incurred by Norilsk
Nickel without triggering veto rights of the parties under
the Agreement (and excluding capital expenditures associated with Bystrinskiy project and funded on the projectﬁnancing basis) are limited to USD4.4 billion in aggregate in 2016-2018. Preliminary decomposition of capital
expenditures is expected to be as following:

Innovations and Scientific Projects New Electronic Cells

1)

USD1.5 billion in 2016;

2)

USD1.5 billion in 2017; and

3)

USD1.4 billion in 2018.

In addition to the above and to the capital expenditures associated with Bystrinskiy project, the following
capital expenditures are excluded from the limits and can
be incurred by Norilsk Nickel without triggering veto rights
of the parties under the Agreement: expenditures related
to modernization of facilities of (1) Nadezhinskiy metallurgical works and (2) Copper metal works aimed to decrease
emission of sulphur dioxide until relevant expenditures
do not exceed USD2 billion in aggregate. Such additional
exemption from the scope of veto rights is applicable only
if the ratio of Norilsk Nickel’s Net Debt to Norilsk Nickel’s
EBITDA does not exceed 2.5x.

The Company has commissioned a pilot site of
eight new generation RA-550 cells at the Sayanogorsk
Aluminium Smelter. Thanks to the design and technological solutions, the RA-550 has many advantages: high
energy eﬃciency (consumes 10-15% less electricity than
the previous generation), the cell design is lighter, more
compact, and environmentally eﬃcient. Stable operation of the RA-550 brings a number of innovative technical solutions to the high-tech technologies that shape the
new standard in the industry: a fundamentally new conﬁguration of the busbar with a two-line current supply, providing a symmetrical magnetic ﬁeld and high MHD stability
without a compensating loop; modular design of the busbar eliminating the restrictions on building reduction cells
of greater power, up to 1,000 kA.
‘The RA-550 project development period and its
implementation, as well as operational maintenance meet
the advanced world standards. As early as at this stage, the
RA-550 technology can be recommended for implementation at new smelters with the amperage of 525 kA conﬁrmed at the prototypes,’ underlined Mr. Barry J. Welch, a
reduction process leading expert.
Environmental approach

CORPORATE STRATEGY
As at 31 December 2017, UC RUSAL’s strategy was to
ensure its long-term sustainable development in challenging market environment through the following strategic moves:
1.

Increasing low-cost and high-eﬃciency production capacities and sales of VAP products. Further
strengthening position on key markets including CIS,
Europe, Asia and the US markets.

2.

Maintaining UC RUSAL’s position as one of the most
eﬃcient and lowest cost producers.

3.

Focus on innovations for core business and new
products developments.

4.

Sustainable and environmentally friendly aluminium.

Environmental measures include the continued
installation of Green Soderberg technology at the Company’s facilities. The transition to Green Soderberg technology involves a number of activities, including construction
of dry and wet two-stage gas-cleaning plants designed
exclusively by RUSAL, implementation of an automated
system to supply raw materials to reduction cells, stateof-the-art automation systems, innovative high-performance systems for gas removal from reduction cells, and
substitution of machinery for manual labor. The newly
developed systems for gas recovery from reduction cells
increase gas removal eﬃciency in terms of the key contaminant – ﬂuorine compounds (F, ﬂuorides) and reduce
emissions by 3.5 times, thus bringing the eco-friendliness
of the Green Soderberg technology to baked anode technologies. Moreover, the dry and wet gas-cleaning complex,
as the most eﬃcient in global practices, allows for capturing both ﬂuorides and sulphur (SO2). Just a few smelters
worldwide are equipped with the integrated gas cleaning
systems with ﬂuoride capture eﬃciency of more than 99%
and SO2 capture eﬃciency of at least 96.5%.

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

About 70% of capacity of Krasnoyarsk Aluminium
Smelter has been switched to the Green Soderberg technology. Bratsk Aluminium Smelter had 62 reduction cells
upgraded in Potroom 8, and gas recovery units installed
in the 2nd potline. Pilot task areas consisting of six new
Green Soderberg reduction cells were launched at Irkutsk
and Novokuznetsk Aluminium Smelters. Green Soderberg
technology is included in the Guide to the Best Available
Technology of Aluminium Production approved by the
order of Rosstandart.
To ensure raw material safety and maintain Green
Soderberg status of Environmental Technology in terms
of polyaromatic constituents of emissions, a technology
has been developed for obtaining environmentally friendly
pitch based on low-temperature dissolution of coal with
oil ingredients and a low content of coke and by-product
process (less than 30-40%). There are no world analogues
of this technology.
A pilot line with an output of 180 t of green pitch
a year has been built. A test batch of pitch and understud
anode paste was produced. Understud anode paste made
of green pitch was assessed from the environmental point
of view on a single reduction cell. Benzo(a)pyrene emissions during the substitution of studs on the environmentally friendly anode paste controller were reduced by
77% compared to substitution of the standard pitch. Total
benzo(a)pyrene on anode surface was reduced by 35%.
The company is making eﬀort to achieve the
minimal carbon footprint. To do this, we used mathematical and physical modelling to deduce the best design of
an industrial inert anode, which was then tested for 120
days and conﬁrmed the stability and performance of inert
anodes in industrial conditions, speciﬁcally in reduction
cell located at KrAZ. In order to expand the site and test
the results for scaling, KrAZ commissioned two more
reduction cells with inert anodes. For the same purpose,
the casthouse was retroﬁtted and the inert anode production site was commissioned, which, in terms of productivity, can provide not only an experimental but also an industrial production scope of inert anodes.
Recycling
In order to increase the energy eﬃciency of aluminium production at relatively recoverable costs, energy
eﬃcient designs of pots are being tested and implemented
at KrAZ, BrAZ, SAZ, NkAZ, and IrkAZ. Speciﬁc electricity
consumption was reduced by over 200-400 kWh/t, while

33

cost of relining of reduction cells was reduced by 50-100
thousand rubles per one cathode using bulk materials.
Moreover, the use of bulk materials provides more room
for recycling. Bulk materials proved to have a recycling rate
of up to 50%. Due to the introduction of bulk materials for
330 reduction cells at SAZ, we have already achieved an
economic beneﬁt of over RUB20 million.
The Company pays much attention to the utilization of solid waste from the production of aluminium sulphates and lining waste. To solve one of these problems,
KrAZ launched a plant for sodium sulphate recovery at a
commercial scale. It reduces the amount of storage on the
mud disposal area with an increase in service life by 6-8
years. Further on, it will allow processing waste into commodity and avoid storing sulphates.
To avoid storing the spent lining, KrAZ completed
the test of the technology for processing carbon lining and
the pilot test of two-stage processing of coal foam (ﬂotation tailings) resulting in 2 commercial products: cryolite
and carbonaceous material concentrate. In order to process the spent lining, the laboratory developed a technology for neutralization with residual concentrations of
CN-ion meeting the MRL requirements and ﬂuorine conversion into CaF2.
The technology encompasses processing red
mud from alumina reﬁneries and making scandium oxide
as a by-product. This advancement boasts a fundamental
diﬀerence from attempts by other companies’ at starting
an economically feasible production of scandium. At UC
RUSAL, the red mud processing technique was embedded
into the conventional alumina production system; it does
not require any acidic, toxic or ﬁre-hazardous chemicals
and does not generate any wastewater. After scandium
oxide is recovered, red mud can be further processed into
a stand-alone product or can be taken to a bauxite residue
disposal area using the ultra-dry technique, which reduces
the capital cost of disposal areas by around 30%.
The pilot unit produced the ﬁrst batch of scandium oxide in 2016 and the material’s purity was over
99%. In 2016 and 2017, UC RUSAL then added a number of improvements to both the process and hardware
parts, which has considerably increased the recovery
rate, improved the quality of scandium concentrate and
reduced the consumption of key chemicals used in the
process.
After such improvements, currently, additional
tests are being performed on the unit to conﬁrm the continuous recovery technique.

Russian Federation issued the Order on permission to use
wire rod made of aluminium alloys for electrical purposes
in residential buildings and structures.
New wire rod production technologies have been
developed for types of wire rod intended for production
of enamel wire and welding wire (production is mastered
on the integrated casting and rolling-pressing unit). Pilot
batches have been successfully certiﬁed by domestic consumers.
In the scope of activities to improve the quality
of products, we developed the technology for production
of slabs with low sodium content for the North American
market. An industrial ultrasonic melt processing plant
has been designed for casting, providing 25% savings of
Al-Ti-B master alloy rod while maintaining a required ﬁnegrained structure.
As part of the developing the ﬁeld of new products, an agreement was signed with the leading producer
of automotive wheels to design and produce lightweight
wheels of UC RUSAL's alloys. Casting alloys of Zincalite
were successfully studied in the laboratories of customers
during the casting of brakes.
Formulas of new aluminium alloys for additive
technologies with increased strength properties, heat
resistance and corrosion resistance have been developed.
Parameters of selective laser melting (SLS) and heat treatment of Al-Si-Cu, Al-Mg-Sc and Al-Mg-Cr-Zr were developed with a low porosity (0.2-0.5%). Mechanical properties of alloys exceed analogues by 20-40%.
To create lightweight rail tank cars for the transportation of nitric acid, a corrosion-resistant aluminium
alloy of increased strength has been developed, which

makes it possible to reduce the tank car weight by 15-20%
thanks to substitution for AD0 alloy. Complex tests were
carried out, which conﬁrmed its eﬃciency.
Scandium-containing aluminium alloy with a
scandium content of 0.1% (2.5 times less than commercial
analogues while maintaining the same level of strength)
was developed. Industrial technologies for the production
of forgings and ﬂat-rolled products have been developed.
Forgings were taken by the consumer to produce a part
designed for a bench testing and subsequent introduction
in the design documentation.
In 2017, more than 50 pallets of home-design
moulds were delivered for slab production in Wagstaﬀ
casting machines as part of the development of in-house
casting equipment at Company’s production facilities
(KrAZ, BrAZ, SAZ). This completely covered the annual
need of facilities in this type of casting equipment.
A fundamentally new design has been developed
and pallets for the slab production for Proﬁlglass have
been manufactured. These pallets allow for the shipment
of slabs without trimming the bottom part and, accordingly, increase the yield product ratio.
In the ﬁeld of improving the alumina production
technology, the Company used miniplant (pilot site) scale
to verify the performance and consumption values of the
alumina chloride technology for producing alumina from
the high-siliceous raw materials of the Siberian region with
OPEX of <USD200 per tonne. As a result of the test, for
the ﬁrst time this alumina chloride technology was used
to produce smelter-grade alumina suitable for processing without restrictions at all operating reduction plants of
the Company. The pilot plant is in the design phase.
The pilot plant for production of scandium oxide
from red mud was introduced with technical solutions
that allow reducing the total costs to USD570 per kg for
industrial-scale production. The material balance is being
calculated for the feasibility study of construction of an
industrial facility.
We also prepared for implementation a highmargin technology for production of precipitated alumina
(FDPA) from AGK’s solutions with a production cost signiﬁcantly lower than that of competitors. The quality is
conﬁrmed by the potential consumer by producing pilot
batches of compound for insulation and cable sheath using
industrial equipment with a full range of standard tests of
cable products. The feasibility study for the construction
of an industrial facility is in progress.

the production facilities and the Head Oﬃce, which conﬁrmed the health and safety management systems’ compliance with the requirements of OHSAS 18001:2007. As
at the Latest Practicable Date, 14 production facilities of
the Company, in addition to the Head Oﬃce, have OHSAS
18001 certiﬁcates.
A sustainable player, engaged in all relevant
industry sustainability initiatives
Primary aluminium production leads to a high
volume of GHG emissions. The main sources of GHG
emissions are carbon anodes consumption due to carbon
oxidation, perﬂuorocarbon emissions and indirect GHG
emissions related to generation of power consumed. Indirect Emissions can be much higher than direct emissions
from aluminium smelting and can be up to 5-10 times
more in case of power generation from coal. The current
average worldwide level of direct and non-direct energy
emissions of aluminium production is 13.41 tCO2eq/tAl.
2016 UC RUSAL level was 3.1 tCO2eq/tAl.

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

In 2007, the Company signed a memorandum of
understanding with the United Nations Development Program. The aim of the memorandum is to implement measures to minimize the Group’s impact on climate change,
by reducing the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions. The
Group is actively participating in the International Aluminium Institute’s activities related to targeting the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions and energy eﬃciency. The
Group has achieved signiﬁcant reductions in greenhouse
gas emissions. For instance, the Group’s aluminium smelters reduced speciﬁc greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 by
61% compared to 1990 emissions levels.

In 2016 the Company has joined Aluminium Stewardship Initiative. The Aluminium Stewardship Initiative
(ASI) is a global, multi-stakeholder, non-proﬁt standards
setting and certiﬁcation organization. It is the result of
producers, users and stakeholders in the aluminium value
chain coming together with a commitment to maximizing the contribution of aluminium to a sustainable society.
ASI’s objectives are:

To perform more accurate calculations, the Company has developed a number of methodologies for determining greenhouse gas emissions which take into account
the features of Company production. The methodologies
take into account the features of production UC RUSAL.
An independent international veriﬁcation BSI has conﬁrmed that our methodologies comply with the requirements of national and international standards and regulations.

To promote measurable and continual improvements in the key environmental, social and
governance impacts of aluminium production,
use and recycling.

The Company has developed programs to
achieve the speciﬁc direct GHG emissions reduction strategic goals at aluminium smelters and alumina reﬁneries
by 15% and 10%, respectively, by 2025 compared to 2014.
(In 2017 aluminium smelters reduced speciﬁc direct GHG
emissions by 2.2% and alumina reﬁneries by 4% compared
to 2014).

UC RUSAL was the ﬁrst Russian company that
joined Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC) – initiative under World Bank that brings together leaders from
government, private sector, academia, and civil society to
expand the use of carbon pricing policies. RUSAL participates in the CPLC research on potential options for carbon pricing in Construction Value Chain to promote lowcarbon decisions in building industry in particular.

To develop a credible assurance and certification system that both mitigates the risks of
non-conformity with ASI standards and minimizes barriers to broad scale implementation.

The Group actively participated in the All-Russian Climate week (May-June 2017) ﬁrst ever organized in
frame of the Year of Ecology in Russia. 15 of RUSAL’s projects were included in the oﬃcial plan of activities. Later on
RUSAL attended some events within Global Climate week
in New York.
The Group participated in the UN climate negotiations as a part of the oﬃcial Russian delegation. The
Group’s achievements on the environment and climate
agenda, i.e. presentation of the new product ALLOW, were
organized at the Russian pavilion at UN Climate Change
Conference in Bonn in November 2017. The special “Low
Carbon Aluminium Day” was attended by approximately
80 Conference participants. The exhibition of the Russian
Federation that was organized in cooperation with RUSAL
and presented state and corporate approaches for the
environmental education met with great interest amongst
the visitors.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Social Investments and Charity
The key social mission of UC RUSAL is to improve the
quality of living for employees and the population of the
countries and regions where the Company operates. The
Company achieves this improvement through investment
in the social infrastructure of the regions, the creation of
new development drivers and social sustainability. Implementation of the Company’s social projects is carried out
in partnership with a wide range of stakeholders, including
regional authorities, non-proﬁt organizations, contractors
and suppliers, medium and small businesses, and population of the cities where the Company operates.
Since 2004 the Company has developed the
organizational infrastructure for local community support
that consists of the interregional network of the corporate
charitable fund The Center for Social Programs (CSP) and
the social entrepreneurship training agency – The Center
for Innovations in Social Sphere (CISS).
The Company operates and supports via CSP and
CISS the following social programs and projects:
“RUSAL territory” program of regional development, which includes grant competitions,
training project “School of urban changes”,
facilitating strategies of urban and social
development of cities;
The program of corporate volunteering “Helping is Easy”, which includes grant competitions, New Year charitable marathon, the
online-portal “Helping is easy”, and the
National Council on corporate Volunteering;
The “Yenisei Day”, a large-scale project of ecological volunteering in Krasnoyarsk Krai and
republics Khakassia and Tuva;
Social entrepreneurship Development Program, which oﬀers six Tools of project support
which are training, consulting, ﬁnancial subsidies, interest-free loans, private investments,
discount interest loans;
Mass sports project “Go Skiing!”, which provides training of trainers, family ski holidays,
children and youth Cup in ski races, operated in
10 cities;

The large-scale social and cultural project
“RUSAL Festival” which features regular festivals of cinema, theater, popular sciences,
bicycle quests in 15 cities of Russia and the city
of Yerevan in Armenia.
The RUSAL Territory Program
“RUSAL territory” is a program of socio-economic development of the regions, which implies a comprehensive
strategic approach to the implementation of the best projects of infrastructural changes in the scale of the whole
city, a separate district, a house or yard. The program is
designed to make people live comfortably and interestingly due to the emergence of new socio-cultural spaces,
the modernization of social infrastructure and the conduct of cultural, educational and sporting events. During 7
years of the program, more than 200 social facilities were
built, repaired and restored, and grants for implementation of 635 social projects of non-proﬁt organizations and
social institutions selected on a competitive basis were
allocated.
The “RUSAL territory” program includes the
annual competition of territorial development projects,
which deﬁnes the best projects of territorial development, aimed at improving the quality of life, the formation
of modern standards of urban architectural and cultural
environment and the involvement of a maximum number
of stakeholders in the process of improvements. Within
the framework of the program CSP conducts social studies to identify current problems and points of territorial
development and the educational project “School of urban
changes” for local community representatives.
During the reporting period 50 new objects
of social infrastructure were created and modernized,
including the facilities and equipment in 24 educational
organizations (schools, kindergartens, technical colleges,
children’s centers of arts and technical creativity), in ﬁve
cultural institutions (libraries, cultural centers), three
institutions of social protection, two youth organizations,
medical facility in the hospital, two infrastructure facilities
for people with disabilities, and ﬁve urban spaces.
In 2017 the development of the urban environment was continued as one of the priorities of the program. As a result, in Krasnoturyinsk a major urban project
for the reconstruction of the Central Park continued by

landscaping adjacent to Promenade. In Sayanogorsk, the
improvement of the “Park of Active recreation” and the
square in Maina township continued. In Krasnoyarsk a new
area for family recreation was created on the basis of the
high school #152 and the infrastructure for recreation and
educational activities for young people in the Kamenka
Park was completed.
A few spaces for development of local communities were equipped. In Novokuznetsk, the coworkingcenter of social initiatives was established which became
a cultural and public space for development of initiatives
of active citizen and a platform for the laboratory of social
initiatives known as the Social Lab “City for Life“.
The competitive funding winners implemented
several projects in the ﬁeld of innovative, scientiﬁc and
technical creativity for children and youth. The project
“Children’s Workplace Learning Center “City of Masters”
was developed in Novokuznetsk. A specialized competence center “Construction of alloys and materials” was
created at the school #22 in Krasnoyarsk. In Krasnoturyinsk two educational facilities were created – the “Neolab”
center for technical creative classes and “MediaHub” center for training young people the skills in programming and
development of mobile applications. In Krasnoturyinsk
a club of technical creativity was opened, and in Severouralsk the workshop for technical work and creativity
opened in the city school #13.
In Volgograd, a training ground was technically
equipped for practical training in the children’s Driving
School in order to teach children safe behavior on the
roads. In Severouralsk the construction of a children’s
Auto-city was completed. In Tayozhny township of Krasnoyarsk Territory the consulting room for social and home
orientation of children with disabilities was equipped in the
boarding school.
During the reporting period of the program, signiﬁcant sports facilities were created: The “Snow Park” in
Bratsk, the High Rope Courses “Vertical” and “Bike Park”
for ﬁgure driving and bike-trial in Volgograd; sports court
for all age categories in Krasnoturyinsk; interschool sports
stadium in Kamensk-Uralsky, 3 open sports grounds in
Shelekhov city. The repair and equipping was carried out
at the ski base of the Children and Youth Sports School in
Cheremukhovo township near Severouralsk.

The ﬁrst in Sayanogorsk rehabilitation center
was equipped for complex treatment of adults and children with disfunction of the central and peripheral nervous
system and musculoskeletal apparatus.
School of Urban Changes
School of Urban Changes is the educational project that
enhances the eﬀectiveness of all implemented UC RUSAL’s social programs. The School helps to prepare project teams that are able to develop and implement social
projects aimed at the development of urban spaces and
accessible environments in residential areas, the organization of cultural events and much more.
70 events of the School of Urban Changes took
place in 11 cities to initiate actual projects, to increase
the project culture of the contest participants, to involve
stakeholders and new subjects in the processes of urban
change. The schools were held in diﬀerent formats which
included lectures, workshops, master classes, group work,
brainstorming sessions, strategic meetings, discussions,
etc. More than 30 experts in the ﬁeld of social design, management, construction and architecture, business trainers
and consultants on development strategy, urban planning
and strategic development, supported by more than 70
partners. The school aroused great interest among the
representatives of authorities, heads of non-proﬁt organizations, grantees, businessmen and mass media. In 2017,
2,635 people took part in the sessions of School of Urban
Changes.
The results of the meetings in the framework of
School of Urban Changes have become new ideas, projects and solutions for the development of urban spaces. In
addition, the formation of communities of residents, local
government representatives and urban professionals,
who jointly develop a vision for local urban development.
Such groups developed during the sessions of School of
Urban Changes a number of social initiatives that include
two projects in Kamensk-Uralsky – the "Iset-river Coast"
on landscaping the recreational area on the ski-boat station and the Art-ground "Kamensk Arbat"; two projects in
Krasnoturyinsk – the Promenade and the Sports ground; in
Sayanogorsk – the "Center of Attraction" park, in Achinsk
– the Youth park, Theatrical Alley, and others.

The “Helping is Easy” program
The “Helping is easy” program is aimed at the development of corporate and urban volunteer movement. Its task
is to involve employees of UC RUSAL and partner companies, their families and communities of active residents
in volunteer activities, participation in modern charitable
events, initiation and organization of such events.
In 2017, the Company conducted two contests
of volunteer projects “Helping is Easy” in the framework
of the program, two contests of environmental volunteer
projects “Green Wave”, the “Yenisey Day” environmental
Marathon in Krasnoyarsk and Sayanogorsk, the VII annual
New Year Marathon “We Believe in a Miracle, We Create a
Miracle!”, and many other local volunteer activities.
As a result of the “Helping is Easy” contest the
ﬁnancial support was provided to 142 volunteer initiatives
and projects aimed at working with socially unprotected
groups, development of pro bono volunteering, conducting educational events for volunteers. A great request
from the applicants for the competition in 2017 was to
support initiatives on training and communication events
for existing volunteer communities. Among the supported
initiatives there were a number of projects, including the
School of volunteers in Volgograd, the Festival of volunteer ideas and the “Volunteers 2.0” educational project in Krasnoturyinsk, the game training “Volunteers, to
marks” in Novokuznetsk. All projects were characterized
by an interesting, rich contents of activities and creative
training approaches. A few projects of portable volunteer
theaters were supported, among which there is a project
of portable theater for children’s hospital in Krasnoyarsk
where the volunteer clowns conduct performances to
entertain young patients. A similar project was launched
in Novokuznetsk under the name “Theater in Suitcase”.
Another creative project was supported in Achinsk, where
the young people with disabilities will arrange a portable
puppet theater “Curly Hedgehog” and play roles in its
volunteer performances. Besides these projects the allocated funding supported projects of mentoring in orphanages and social institutions.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Within the framework of the “Green Wave” contest of environmental volunteer projects, the support was
provided to 78 initiatives of volunteer groups on landscaping and improvement of yards, streets, pedestrian alleys.
The New Year’s charitable Marathon was held in
2017 and united over 1,500 volunteers in 19 cities, most
of whom represented the employees of the partner companies. The volunteer teams have organized more than
500 diﬀerent charitable events and helped 8,700 people in
need and 146 organizations. In 2017, the prize pool for the
participating volunteer teams was increased to RUB3.5
million. The winning teams decided to direct their ﬁnancial prizes to the charitable organizations in all cities of the
project. The most massive events of the New Year marathon were charitable fairs aimed at raising funds for treatment and rehabilitation of severely ill children, supporting
social institutions and charitable foundations from all over
the country. As a result of the charitable fairs, the amount
of RUB875,000 was raised and directed to the recipients.
In 2017, chaired by UC RUSAL the National Council for Corporate Volunteering continued working in partnership with more than 30 participating companies and
organizations. Its task was to consolidate the accumulated
experience and knowledge in the ﬁeld of volunteering and
foster the development of corporate volunteering in Russia.
In 2017, the ecological marathon “Yenisei Day” in
Krasnoyarsk expanded the format by involving local residents through pilot eco-points set up on the banks of the
river. Every weekend a group of volunteers worked on the
embankment and oﬀered visitors to collect the trash after
picnic and place it to the garbage bins set in a few ecopoints at the embankment. The responsible holidaymakers were awarded little memorable souvenirs for each collected garbage package.
In 2017 the volunteer youth councils continued
active work at 11 plants. They took part and some of them
won in the “Helping is Easy” and "Green Wave" contests.

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

Their 16 volunteer initiatives were among other winners of
these grant competitions. The projects of youth councils
are aimed at guidance of children in diﬃcult life situations,
as well as creative work with children in supported social
institutions.

pants of the SSE online course. The Center of innovations
in the social sphere (CISS), operating the program, in 2017
received a license to conduct educational services which
allowed the participants obtaining a certiﬁcate of qualiﬁcation improvement upon completion of the SSE learning
program.

Development of social entrepreneurship
In 2017, UC RUSAL continued the development of social
entrepreneurship in the regions where the Company
operates.
The Company provided a complex of supportive measures
for growth of social entrepreneurship, that include:
Educational program of the School of social
entrepreneurship (SSE);
Methodological, organizational and consulting
support for newly beginning social entrepreneurs;
Promoting mutual support of social entrepreneurs by creating a community of program participants and SSE graduates;
Promotion of services and goods of social
entrepreneurs in order to increase demand for
them by state and municipal authorities and
other regional organizations.
In 2017, the Center of Innovations in the Social
Sphere (CISS) operating the program, trained 177 new
participants in the intramural SSE program held in Krasnoyarsk, Novokuznetsk, Kamensk-Uralsky and Krasnoturyinsk. The residents of the program actively participated
in various local and national competitions for additional
supportive measures. In 2017, the SSE graduates ran 42
business projects with social impact.
The SSE program developed into a format
of extramural studies, and since March 2017 the CISS
launched the online course, which made the SSE course
available for participants from all Russian regions and other
countries. In 2017, more than 700 people became partici-

In partnership with the Impact Hub Moscow,
which is the community center for young social entrepreneurs and a part of the international network, the Company implemented in 4 cities (Kamensk-Uralsky, Krasnoturyinsk, Krasnoyarsk and Novokuznetsk) the “Social
Impact Award” international competition, aimed at supporting and promotion of social entrepreneurship among
the youth. Eighty-ﬁve young people took part in the preparatory training sessions; 12 projects from all the four
cities were among the national top-ﬁfty. Moreover, ﬁve
of them reached the ﬁnal and were awarded free training
in the International Acceleration Program "90-Days Challenge" operated by the Impact Hub. On the stage of the
ﬁnal competition, the Company’s SSE graduates showed
the best results among participants from all over Russia.
The winner was the "Kinesthetic-center" project from
Novokuznetsk. This startup helps children and adults with
disabilities and teaches relatives and professionals to care
properly about the sick. The project developers organize
seminars, conduct author's courses, individual and family
consultations based on the concept of Kinesthesis that
means the perception of body movements. The Creativity
center established by the SSE graduate Anna Voshchikova
in Kamensk-Uralsky for children and teenagers with cerebral palsy and autism was awarded in the "Open World"
special nomination of the Social Impact Award presented
by the Heinrich Böll Foundation.
UC RUSAL continues to search for the most
promising innovative ideas and projects and works on their
eﬀective implementation in the social sphere and socioeconomic development of the regions where the Company operates.
In 2017, the Company allocated more than
USD23.9 million for social programs and charitable projects.

OVERVIEW OF TRENDS IN THE ALUMINIUM
INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
Highlights for the full year 2017
Global aluminium demand rose by 6% in 2017
to 64 million tonnes, amid coordinated economic growth in major regions of the world,
including China, Europe and North America.
In 2018, global demand is expected to build on
the positive foundations of the past year to
increase by 5% to 67.3 million tonnes. Robust
demand growth left the global aluminum
market balance in a deficit at around 1 million
tonnes in 2017 and is expected to rise to above
2 million tonnes in 2018.
Global aluminium supply is expected to grow
by 2.8% in 2018 compared to 5.7% growth in
2017. In China there is strong evidence of the
implementation of supply side reform in the
Chinese aluminum industry in 2017 with more
than 10 million illegal operating capacity and
projects having been cut.

As estimated significant part of aluminium
smelters closed during current winter cuts season will not return to the market due to severe
environmental regulation for smelters emissions in 26+2 cities, high restarting costs and
current low proﬁtability.
Chinese semis exports stay under significant
pressure from international anti-dumping initiatives and Introduction of new tariﬀs including for Chinese aluminium export to US under
section 232 will potentially further increase
from current 20-23 cents to 25-28 cents.
The reported aluminium inventories in the
world ex-China fell further to ~ 2.9 million
tonnes at the end of 2017, down ~ 1.0 million
tonnes from the level at the end of 2016 to historical low level for stock to consumption ratio
of 36 days compared to 115 days peak in mid of
2015.

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

Global aluminium
The LME aluminium price rose 22.7% YoY in 2017
and reached USD2,256/t on January 2, 2018, nearly a sixyear high, consolidating later at a new level of USD2,200/t
as a result of widespread capacity cuts in China and a
steady reduction of LME stocks - further evidence of a
global market deﬁcit. The rising cost inﬂation in China
made a signiﬁcant share of operating Chinese aluminium
capacity barely breakeven by the end of 2017.
Aluminium demand
Global aluminium demand rose by 6% to 64.2 million tonnes in 2017. In the world excluding China, demand
grew by 3.7% to 29.2 million tonnes, while Chinese demand
increased by 7.8% to 34.9 million tonnes.
Despite high aluminium prices there is a slow
process of restarting capacity capability outside of China
due to lack of comparative power tariﬀ and high restarting
costs.
China continued to lead global growth in 2017,
with its economy confounding expectations of a slowdown. Full year GDP increased by 6.9%, an upturn from
the 6.7% pace of 2016 and well above the oﬃcial target
of 6.5%. The key driver of aluminium demand, industrial
production, mirrored the improvement in the broader
economy, accelerating to 6.6% growth in 2017, from 6%
the prior year. There was broad based strength across the
major aluminium consuming industrial sectors, with construction, manufacturing and transportation all remaining
robust. Floor space under construction started in 2017,
rose by 10.5%, while auto production rose by 2.1%, but
growth in production of commercial vehicles was much
sharper, up by 13.8%. Strong investment in the power sector, especially in green energy, also provided further impetus to aluminium demand.
In North America, underlying demand began
the year cautiously before strengthening through the
year. There was a welcome return to positive growth in
industrial production in 2017, rising by 1.8% in the United
States, following a contraction the prior year. Despite a
3.9% decline in North American motor vehicle production,
aluminium demand from the sector grew strongly, amid
rising intensity of use, especially in the rolled products
sector. Construction activity remained solid, with housing starts rising by 2.4% to 1.1 million units, and pointing
to a robust outlook for extrusions demand given the lag
between starts and aluminium consumption in the build.
In 2017 as a whole, primary aluminium demand rose by an
estimated 2.6% to 6.8 million tonnes.

51

The recovery in the Eurozone economy was particularly impressive, with industrial activity improving
throughout 2017. Manufacturing PMIs were illustrative of
this trend, hitting multi-year highs in regional heavyweights
Germany, France and Italy and even the UK shrugged oﬀ
Brexit fears to increase through the year. The Eurozone
manufacturing PMI ended the year at 60.6, its loftiest level
since the currency group was formed. In a similar vein, the
construction market built on strong growth in 2016, with
further gains last year, which resulted in the production in
construction index for Euro 28 countries also hitting multiperiod highs. The pace of the auto market slowed slightly
but vehicle output still rose by an estimated 1.4% across
the region, although as in the US, intensity of use gains
meant that sectoral aluminium demand ran well ahead of
car production. This conﬂuence of positive factors led to
aluminium demand growth of 3.2% to 9.4 million tonnes in
Europe (including Turkey but excluding Russia).
Japan’s economy carried on the strong momentum from the end of the previous year to accelerate in
2017, driven by a recovery in the industrial sector. This
led to industrial production growth estimated at 4.4%,
after a minor contraction in 2016. A key component of this
growth was automotive, with vehicle production accelerating by an expected 5.6% for the full year, bouncing back
from a decline in 2016. The construction market fared
less well, with housing starts contracting by a modest
0.1%, although sectoral aluminium demand still increased,
beneﬁting from follow through from buildings that began
construction the prior year. In addition to the strength
of underlying domestic demand, Japan was boosted by
a strong global economy, which was supportive of its
exports. This was evident in the aluminium sector as well
as the broader manufacturing sector.
Economic activity has remained strong in the
ASEAN region, as GDP in major countries such as Thailand,
Vietnam and Indonesia, grew at a rate of between 4 and
7%. The region as a whole continues to beneﬁt from major
macro drivers such as industrialization and urbanization, in
addition to investment in downstream industry, including
in aluminium. This will result in primary aluminium demand
increasing to 6.5 million tonnes or 3.5% in the Asian region
(ex China & India) in 2017.

52

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
A N D A N A LY S I S

The other major growth driver in the rest of Asia
is India, and although its economy slowed in 2017, amid
economic reforms, the rate of increase in GDP would still
be the envy of most developed countries. GDP is expected
to have grown by 6.2% over the year as a whole, although
picking up speed in the ﬁnal two quarters. Industrial production followed a similarly positive trend, pointing to an
acceleration in growth in 2018. Even with a slowdown in
the economy, primary aluminium demand still rose by an
impressive 5.6% to 2.1 million tonnes in 2017.
In our home market of Russia, following two years
of negative economic growth, GDP rose by an estimated
1.9% in 2017. A recovery in oil prices supported government revenues and this is fed through into increased government spending on infrastructure. This boosted demand
across a range of end uses but especially in the electrical
sector. A change in regulations to allow aluminium wiring
in buildings during 2017 provides a bullish backdrop for
further consumption growth. Primary aluminium demand
in Russia grew by 10.9% to 0.8 million tonnes in 2017 and
expected to rise to 0.90-0.95 million tonnes in 2018.

Larger losses may take place in carbon materials supply including anodes and coking coal, that would to
exert an upward pressure on the costs bases for aluminium
producers due to squeezes in raw materials supply chain.
Strong antipollution controls and environmental measures continue to be focused towards the energy
intensive industries in China in 2018 with intention to further cap and reduce CO2 emissions. Several heavely aluminium producing provinces plan to curb CO2 emissions
by 20-23% on average by 2020 from the 2015 level. Starting this year Chinese aluminum smelters start paying environmental tax potentially increasing production costs by
70-100 RMB/tonne for big producers.
In addition to China domestic regulatory measures, Chinese semis exports stay under signiﬁcant pressure from international anti-dumping initiatives and possible introduction of new duties on Chinese semis exported
to the US. This may result in a continued drop of exports
of Chinese FRP and other aluminium semis products to
United States, the second largest Chinese semis consuming market.

Global supply
Global aluminium supply rose by 5.7% to 63.5
million tonnes in 2017. In the world excluding China, supply
grew by 1% to 27.2 million tonnes, while Chinese supply
increased by 9.5% to 36.4 million tonnes.
In China there is strong evidence of the implementation of Supply Side reform in the Chinese aluminum
industry in 2017 with more than 10 million illegal operating capacity and project cuts. As a result, according to
Aladdiny data annualized Chinese aluminum production
in November has dropped to 35.4 million tonnes from its
maximum of 38.6 million tonnes in July of 2017.
The announcement by the Chinese regulator regarding winter capacity cuts which have now been
implemented will result in an annualized production losses
of approximately 1 million tonnes of metal, and 4.4 million
tonnes of alumina, according to UC RUSAL estimates. As
estimated signiﬁcant part of aluminium closed smelters
during current winter cuts season will not return to the
market due to sevear environmental regulation for smelters emissons in 26+2 cities, high restarting costs and current low proﬁtability.

RUSAL'S ALUMINIUM PRODUCTION RESULTS
The Group's primary aluminium production for the year
ended 31 December 2017 was practically ﬂat as compared
to the previous year and totalled 3,707 thousand tonnes
(+0.6% YoY).
Production of VAP went up from 1.713 million
tonnes in 2016 to 1.852 million tonnes in 2017, with the
share of VAP increasing from 46.5% to 50.8% in 2017.

Energy eﬃciency:
Actions of the energy eﬃciency projects were
successfully implemented at all aluminium
smelters of the Aluminium Division. The implementation of energy eﬃciency actions in 2017
allowed to decrease the specific power consumption for the whole production facility in
the aluminium smelters of the Aluminium Division by 417 kWh/t compared to 2013 (when the
project started);
Tests of energy eﬃcient pot designs were successfully completed in KrAZ, BrAZ, SAZ, KhAZ,

production facilities of the Division. Introduction of the energy efficient structure in S-255
pots continues at SAZ in the course of relining;
the successful OA-120 pot design is being further replicated at KrAZ.

Use of new mechanical equipment in potrooms:
In 2017, Limited Liability Company "Russian
Engineering Company" (REC) produced 34
production machines, including new hi-tech
anode treatment machines supplied to IrkAZ.
Supply of small production machines continues
(10 units were additionally delivered to KrAZ).
Crane facilities are being developed in the following areas: Mechanization of the anode specialist’s work in the Soderberg area, transition
to radio control of cranes, expanding the functions of cranes in pre-baked anode potrooms.
Health, safety, environment (HSE):
Production facilities of the Aluminium Division
confirmed compliance of their respective HSE
management systems with OHSAS 18001 following an external audit by DNV.

Increase in production of alloys:
Modernization in 2017 of the Befesa2 line at
IrkAZ, increase of foundry alloys production
capacity from 138 thousand t/year (in 2016) to
149 thousand t/year (in 2017).
Start-up in 2017 of a new wire rod quenching
complex, increasing the production of 6101
alloy from 4,050 t/year (2017) to 5,150 t/year
(in the 2018 business plan).
In 2017, a Properzi continuous horizontal casting line was commissioned at KhAZ with the
planned capacity of up to 120 ktpa of 10-kg
bars.

ALUMINA PRODUCTION RESULTS
UC RUSAL’s total attributable alumina output was 7,773
thousand tonnes in 2017 and 7,528 thousand tonnes in
2016. The increase of alumina output in 2017 by 245 thousand tonnes (3.3%) was due to implementation of production capacity increase program at UAZ and NGZ as well as
a result ofthe more stable operation of AGK and BAZ.

UC RUSAL’s total attributable bauxite output4 was 11,645
thousand tonnes in 2017, as compared to 12,187 thousand tonnes in 2016. The decrease in bauxite production

at Windalco is due to climatic conditions (oﬀ-season rainfall). In 2017, 43 new wagons had been shipped to CBK with
immediate commissioning. In 2017 haulage equipment
renovation project has started at BCGI.

Silicon production:

Powders:

The decrease in the output in 2017 is mainly due
to the planned maintenance of the main equipment: at JSC
Kremny – capital repairs of 2 furnaces and at OOO SUALKremny-Ural – 2 capital repairs and one average repair of
furnaces.

The 2017 output showed practically no change
year-on-year (-0.8%). And although the domestic construction market shrunk in 2017 by 7-10% from the previous year, RUSAL managed to increase its sales of aluminium powders and pastes (used as gas-forming agents in
construction) and thus raise its market share to 81%. This
growth became possible after the Company has promptly
responded to the changing payment terms in the market. The Company also expanded and re-distributed its
export sales, where sales coarse aluminium powders were
reduced by 10% in favor of ﬁne powders (+55%).

In 2017, measures are being taken to improve
the quality of the produced silicon within the scope of
the programme for 100% supply of RUSAL aluminium
smelters with own silicon: reﬁning volumes are increased,
requirements to the quality of incoming raw materials are
increased, including additional processing of quartzite
mined at the Company’s mines.
The construction of the GTC at SUAL-KremnyUral has been completed, and pilot operation is underway. At JSC Kremny the design plans and speciﬁcation
for construction of GTC-1,2 received a positive review of
the non-state expert examination. Construction permit is
issued.
A special permit (license) for the extraction of
quartzite at the Glukhov Mine (Ukraine) was obtained and
is valid until 2037.

In 2017, the Powder Business Directorate of
RUSAL Volgograd commissioned a new equipment –
grinding and classifying unit VKV-777, which will produce
special foaming agents in demand for the domestic and
foreign manufacturers of Autoclaved Aerated Concrete.
One of the priority areas of aluminium powder industry is the implementation of the project for the
development of special alloys and production of metallic powders for 3D printing (additive technologies). Under
the scope of this project, the Powder Business Directorate
of RUSAL Volgograd and SUAL PM produced pilot lots of
AlSi10Mg powders and high-strength aluminium alloys.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
A N D A N A LY S I S

In addition, the project for developing a new
group of aluminium pigment products with wet grinding
technology for the paint and varnish industry is now in
development.
Secondary alloys:
The increase in production volumes is due to the involvement of 3XXX, 6XXX bars from the aluminium smelters
located in the Siberian region. It required an additional
melting furnace to be temporarily demothballed.

ALUMINIUM
Aluminium production results
The New Projects Directorate
The New Projects Directorate comprises the Volgograd
aluminium smelter, Nadvoitsy aluminium smelter, Volkhov
aluminium smelter (all in Russia), ALSCON (Nigeria), the
aluminium sections of the Bogoslovsky and Ural smelters
(in Russia), as well as the secondary alloys facility.
The current status of aluminium production facilities shut down in 2013 at BAZ, VAZ, UAZ, and Alscon, in
2017 remains unchanged.

Nadvoitsy aluminium smelter: dismantling of
steel structures of the reduction cells in Potroom 1 continues; Potroom 4 operates using its own electricity generated by the leased Onda HPP.
Volgograd aluminium smelter: in 2017, after
signing of a free bilateral agreement for the supply of
electricity, resumed the reduction process: from May to
December, 122 capital repairs of cells in Potrooms 2 and 5
were completed, 120 reduction cells were commissioned.
At the same time, remelting of solid metal continued in the
Casthouse; 44,000 tonnes of high added value products
were produced, of which 13,000 tonnes were produced
from own raw aluminium and 31,000 tonnes were produced by remelting of hard metal. The area for production
of anode paste produced 37.81 kt to meet the needs of the
Kandalaksha Aluminium Smelter. Implementation of the
project for management of production of baked anodes
continues.

One of the areas of development of the New
Projects Directorate is the search, development, and
implementation of projects aimed at increasing the consumption of aluminium and aluminium alloys. The main
areas for the implementation of new projects are the areas
of mothballed production.
The industrial site of NAZ was used to continue the project on managing the production
of aluminium domestic heaters. The project is
executed jointly with ELSO-GROUP (50/50).
In April, the production facility was granted
the status of a resident of the Priority Social
and Economic Development Area. By the end
of 2017, the yield ratio was up to 67%. Around
5,600 sections were cast. 1,000 sections were
shipped to consumers in December. Casting is
performed using Sanwave moulds. In 2017, 2
moulds were ordered and successfully tested
at the manufacturer’s plant (Costampress,
Italy). The final test of moulds began at the
Russian Radiator LLC on 25 January 2018 with
the participation of the manufacturer.
OOO Bogoslovsky Cable Factory (BKZ). It was
established in April 2017 as part of the longterm agreement for the exercise of rights of
participants with ELKA-Cable. This was a joint
venture for the production of cables and wires
in Krasnoturyinsk. BKZ was granted the status
of resident of the Priority Social and Economic
Development Area in 2017. Within the scope
of the project, the bulk of the equipment for
the ﬁrst stage of production was bought out –
Drawing and twisting shop No 1. In August to
December 2017, production of a semi-ﬁnished
flexible cable (multiwire strand and conductor of various cross-section) was started,
which until December 2018 will be the ﬁnished
product of BKZ. In 2017, the output of semifinished products amounted to 47.7 tonnes of
aluminium. In 4Q 2017, the reconstruction of
Shop No 2 was started; it is the main site of the
future plant.

Coal production results
The aggregate coal production attributable to
the Company’s 50% share in Bogatyr Coal LLP increased
by 15% to 20,204 kt in 2017, as compared to 17,525 kt in
2016. The increase in volume in 2017 as compared to 2016
was due to increased sales of coal to Kazakh customers
resulting from increased regional demand.

Transportation results
Total coal and other goods carried by rail Bogatyr
Trans LLC, attributable to a 50% share of the company
decreased by 0.2% to 6,222 thousand tonnes in 2017,
compared to 6,236 thousand in 2016. The decline in 2017
compared to 2016 was due to a decrease in the delivery of coal in Kazakhstan, which was partially oﬀset by an
increase in the transportation of coal in Russia.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
A N D A N A LY S I S

Total cost of sales increased by USD1,153 million,
or 19.1%, to USD7,183 in 2017, as compared to USD6,030
million in 2016. The increase was driven by an increase in
volumes of primary aluminium and alloys sold as well as signiﬁcant increase in electricity prices, railway transportation
tariﬀs and other raw material costs in Russian Ruble in 2017.
Cost of alumina was almost ﬂat in 2017 compared
to 2016.
Cost of bauxite increased by 24.2% in 2017
compared to the previous year, primarily as a result of an
increase in purchase volume and a slight increase in purchase prices.
Cost of raw materials (other than alumina and
bauxite) and other costs increased by 22.3% in 2017
compared to the previous year, due to a rising raw materials purchase price (prices for raw pitch coke increased
by 74.5%, raw petroleum coke by 18.1%, pitch by 46.7%,
caustic soda by 47.8%).
Energy costs increased by 31.8% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to 13.0% appreciation of Rus-

sian Ruble against US dollar between the comparable periods.
Distribution, administrative and other expenses
Distribution expenses increased by 18.6% to
USD446 million in 2017, compared to USD376 million in
2016, primarily due to the increase in transportation tariﬀs
as well as the continuing appreciation of the Russian Ruble
against the US Dollar between the periods.
Administrative expenses, which include personnel costs, increased by 19.0% to USD632 million in 2017,
compared to USD531 million in 2016 and primarily resulted
from the appreciation of the Russian Ruble to the US Dollar within the comparable periods.
Gross profit
As a result of the foregoing factors, UC RUSAL
reported a gross proﬁt of USD2,786 million for the year
ended 31 December 2017 as compared to USD1,953 million for the previous period, representing gross margins of
the periods of 27.9% and 24.5%, respectively.

NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSS

TOTAL INCOME/EXPENSES

Finance income increased by USD2 million, or
10.5% to USD21 million in 2017 compared to USD19 million for the same period of 2016 due to an increase in foreign exchange gain which was partially oﬀset a decrease
in interest income on third party loans and deposits at
several subsidiaries of the Group. Financial expenses was
almost ﬂat in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a
decrease in the interest expense on bank loans and net
foreign exchange result that was partially oﬀset by an
increase in the net loss from the change in fair value of
derivative ﬁnancial instruments and an increase in bank
charges.

Interest expenses in 2017 decreased by USD53
million to USD477 million from USD530 million in 2016 following the successful restructuring of the Group’s loan
portfolio. The same factor caused an increase in bank
charges as a result of amortization of previously capitalized arrangement fees.
The net loss from the change in fair value of
derivative ﬁnancial instruments increased to USD287
million in 2017 from USD157 million for the same period
of 2016 following signiﬁcant LME and other commodities
price improvement between the comparable periods that
negatively aﬀected the fair value of respective hedging
instruments.

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

The average maturity of the Group’s debt as at 31 December 2017 was 4.2 years.

SECURITY
As of 31 December 2017, the Group’s debt (save for unsecured loans from Gazprombank (project ﬁnance), and
Bonds) is secured, among others, by assignment of receivables under speciﬁed contracts, pledges of shares and
interests in certain operating and non-operating companies, goods, designated accounts, shares in MMC Norilsk
Nickel (representing a 25% +1 share of MMC Norilsk Nickel’s total nominal issued share capital).

In August the Company and Sberbank agreed
to amend existing facilities secured by Norilsk
Nickel shares, extending ﬁnal maturity to 2024,
reducing interest margin from 4.75% to 3.75%
and bring covenant package generally in line
with the PXF.
In January 2018 the Company entered into a
bilateral facility agreement with Nordea Bank

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
A N D A N A LY S I S

An internship programme dubbed “New Generation” was launched in 2017 as part of the external talent
pool development. The programme mainly aims to rejuvenate the Company’s workforce by attracting young specialists with a high potential. Participants were selected from
among the best graduates of target educational institutions, with high average marks (at least 4.5 for white-collar
personnel), English language skills, readiness to relocated
etc. For each intern, a mentor is appointed who then develops an individual development plan and helps the intern
adapt to a new environment, and set and achieve professional goals. Internship lasts for 6 months, during which
participants tackle interesting and complicated projects
and then defend them in front of their department and the
head of HR. Provided the defence was successful, a decision may be made to oﬀer full-time employment. In 2017,
the programme attracted 195 participants, and over 80%
of them have since become RUSAL’s employees. For next
year, the plan is to admit over 200 new interns.
In 2017, the Company started a project entitled:
‘RUSAL Laboratory’ Corporate center of youth initiatives’
to improve quality of trainings for students with related
occupations as well as to engage talented students in
Company’s development projects. As of today the Company has reached an agreement with the Siberian Federal
University, the Irkutsk National Research Technical University, the Siberian State Industrial University, the Volgograd Technical University and the Moscow Institute of
Steel and Alloys to open the Laboratory.
In 2017, pupils were taken on tours to Company’s
productions and provided with career guidance. During
the year our productions were visited by over 1,000 pupils.
Company’s productions actively participate in the education provided by related organizations by granting of available space to students for their production ﬂoor workshops and practical trainings. In 2017, over 1,000 students
from supporting colleges and universities received their
practical trainings.
In 2017, to provide career guidance and promote
blue-collar jobs RUSAL trained 8 teams (16 juniors) and
sent them to the ‘Professionals of the Future’ Championship of Corporations by the JuniorSkills procedure: 3
teams from Krasnoturyinsk, 4 – from Severouralsk and 1
from Shelekhov. Also in 2017 the ‘Robotics’ corporate programme was expanded for school pupils and college stu-

dents – 5 more schools and 4 more colleges were included.
Equipment was purchased and coaches were trained for
new sites.
Forming and developing the internal talent pool
In 2017, there were 1,628 people from the succession pool were trained (subjects are listed below),
among them, there are new development projects – the
‘Proﬁciency School’ (156 people trained) and the ‘Apprenticeship School’ (330 people trained). In 2018, the projects
are to be rolled out to other productions of UC RUSAL.
In 2017, BS-250 succession pool candidates
were trained in managerial competences. There were 15
trainings held for 254 participants. Subjects of the trainings were: public presentations, target setting – tools and
practice as well as inspiring leadership.
During 2017 there were 770 practical workshops
arranged for succession pool candidates. There were 64
(8%) of the practical inter-divisional workshops among
them.
In 2016, 919 reservists were trained in the following areas (including, without limitation): manager’s internal and external communications; strategic team building;
corporate entrepreneurship business simulation; public
performance under pressure, business result focus; leader
and team; persuasive communication and basic managerial skills training.
Training personnel within functional academies
The Company continuously develops its personnel training systems through systematising and developing professional training of workers, managers, specialists
and clerks, raising the relevancy of functional academies,
and creating target modular programs for business objectives. The approach to the preparation of training in areas
within functional academies was revised, experts for areas
were deﬁned, and topics of training were developed. Due
to the new approach to developing topics for functional
academies, employees raise their skills in accordance with
the Company’s targets and strategy.

BUSINESS RISKS
In order to reduce the negative eﬀects of potential dangers and to ensure stable and sustainable business development, the Company pays particular attention to building an eﬀective risk management system.
Risk management is a part of the competence of
the risk management group created by the Board as a part
of the Directorate for Control. The main internal documents governing activity in this area are:
The Risk Management Policy, which determines
the general concept and employee obligations
in the risk management process; and
The Regulations on Risk Management, which
organize the risk management process and
include a description of the key tools and methods for identifying, assessing and mitigating
risks.

The key elements of the Company’s risk management system are: deﬁning and assessing risks, developing
and implementing risk mitigation measures, risk management reporting, and assessing the performance of the risk
management system.

KEY STEPS TAKEN IN RISK MANAGEMENT
Organizing independent risk audits at Company enterprises conducted by specialists of
the Willis Group and the Ingosstrakh Engineering Center to reduce risks and optimize the
Company’s insurance program
Preparation of an annual Corporate Risk Map
by the Directorate for Control and its quarterly
updating
Performance of risk management system
reviews and audits by the Directorate for Control
Preparation of the UC RUSAL risk insurance
programs

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION
A N D A N A LY S I S

MONITORING, REPORTING AND
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF THE RISK
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Directorate for Control regularly reports on its activities to the Board and Audit Committee. As part of these
reports, the Directorate for Control provides information
on the risk management system, the results of preparing
risk maps, new risks, and the mitigation of various types
of risks.
The Audit Committee oversees how well management monitors compliance with the Company’s risk
management policies and procedures. Based on the
reporting submitted, the Audit Committee and the Board
review the Company’s risk proﬁle and the results of its risk
management programs on a quarterly and annual basis
respectively.
In 2017, the Company has identiﬁed the following
risks which aﬀect its business:
1.

2.

3.

The Group operates in a cyclical industry that has
recently experienced price and demand volatility,
which has had and may continue to have a material adverse eﬀect on the Group’s performance and
ﬁnancial results.
The Group’s competitive position in the global aluminium industry is highly dependent on continued
access to inexpensive and uninterrupted electricity
supply, in particular, long-term contracts for such
electricity. Increased electricity prices, as well as
interruptions in the supply of electricity, could have
a material adverse eﬀect on the Group’s business,
ﬁnancial condition and results of operations.
The Group depends on the provision of uninterrupted
transportation services and access to infrastructure
for the transportation of its materials and end products across signiﬁcant distances which is out of the
Company’s control, and the prices for such services
(particularly rail tariﬀs) could increase.

4.

The terms of the credit facility agreements impose
certain limits on the Group’s capital expenditure and
payment of dividends. Failure by the Group to comply
with the terms and conditions of these agreements
may materially adversely aﬀect the Group and its
Shareholders.

5.

The Group is exposed to foreign currency ﬂuctuations which may aﬀect its ﬁnancial results.

6.

En+ is able to inﬂuence the outcome of important
decisions relating to the Group’s business, which
includes transactions with certain related parties.

7.

The Group depends on the services of key senior
management personnel and the strategic guidance
of Mr. Oleg Deripaska.

8.

Adverse media speculation, claims and other public
statements could adversely aﬀect the value of the
Shares.

9.

The Group’s business may be aﬀected by labor disruptions, shortages of skilled labor and labor cost
inﬂation.

10. The Group relies on third-party suppliers for certain
materials.
11. Equipment failures or other diﬃculties may result in
production curtailments or shutdowns.
12. The Group is subject to certain requirements under
Russian anti-monopoly laws.
13. The Group operates in an industry that gives rise to
health, safety and environmental risks.
14. Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources data are estimates only and are inherently uncertain, and such
Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources may be depleted
more rapidly than anticipated.
15. The Group’s licenses and concession rights to explore
and mine Ore Reserves may be suspended, amended
or terminated prior to the end of their terms or may
not be renewed.
16. The Group is exposed to risks relating to the multijurisdictional regulatory, social, legal, tax and political
environment in which the Group operates.

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

CONTINGENCIES
The Board has reviewed and considered the contingent
liabilities of the Company and disclosed information concerning such contingent liabilities in note 24 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Accordingly, for detailed
information about contingent liabilities, please refer to
note 24 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Details
of the amounts of provisions are also disclosed in note 20
to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Tax contingencies
The new controlled foreign company (“CFC”)
rules have been introduced in Russia starting from 1 January 2015. The rules apply to undistributed proﬁts of nonRussian CFC controlled by Russian tax-resident shareholders. The Company is tax-resident in Cyprus and managed
and controlled from Cyprus and the new CFC rules shall
not directly apply to the Group in relation to any of its nonRussian aﬃliates. The CFC rules may apply to Russian taxresident controlling shareholders of the Company, where
such shareholder controls more than 25% or (10% where
all Russian tax-resident shareholders together control
more than 50%). The rules also introduce certain reporting requirements for such Russian tax-resident controlling
shareholders of the Company in relation to non-Russian
aﬃliates of the Group where such shareholders directly or
indirectly control more than 10% of those aﬃliates.
Legal contingencies
The Group’s business activities expose it to a variety of lawsuits and claims which are monitored, assessed
and contested on an ongoing basis. Where management
believes that a lawsuit or claim would result in the outﬂow
of the economic beneﬁts for the Group, a best estimate
of such outﬂow is included in provisions in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (refer to note 20 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements). As at 31 December 2017, the
amount of claims, where management assess outﬂows as
possible approximate USD36 million (31 December 2016:
USD60 million).

89

In January 2013, the Company received a writ of
summons and statement of claim ﬁled in the High Court
of Justice of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria
(Abuja) by plaintiﬀ BFIG Group Divino Corporation (“BFIG”)
against certain subsidiaries of the Company. It is a claim
for damages arising out of the defendants’ alleged tortious interference in the bid process for the sale of the
Nigerian government’s majority stake in the Aluminium
Smelter Company of Nigeria Plc (“ALSCON”) and alleged
loss of BFIG’s earnings resulting from its failed bid for the
said stake in ALSCON. BFIG seeks compensatory damages in the amount of USD2.8 billion plus interest. In January 2014 the court granted the Company’s motion to join
the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Attorney General of
Nigeria to the case as co-defendants. The last hearing
took place on 8 November 2017. The claim was struck out.
BFIG may appeal.
In January 2018 one of the Company’s subsidiaries, ALSCON and the Bureau of Public Enterprises of Nigeria entered into an addendum to the original sale and purchase contract regarding ALSCON on the key terms and
conditions as it was disclosed in the announcement of the
Company dated 19 January 2018.
Based on a preliminary assessment of the claim,
the Company does not expect the case to have any material adverse eﬀect on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or its
operation as a whole.

codiﬁed by the Countering America’s Adversaries Through
Sanctions Act (CAATSA), as well as E.O. 13582. These
actions follow the Department of the Treasury’s issuance
of the CAATSA Section 241 report in late January 2018.”
The US Treasury Release further states that: “All assets
subject to U.S. jurisdiction of the designated individuals
and entities, and of any other entities blocked by operation of law as a result of their ownership by a sanctioned
party, are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited
from dealings with them. Additionally, non-U.S. persons
could face sanctions for knowingly facilitating signiﬁcant
transactions for or on behalf of the individuals or entities
blocked today.”

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

In addition, OFAC issued two general licenses
in connection with these designations authorising U.S.
persons to engage in certain limited activities and transactions involving the Company or its subsidiaries (the
“Group”). One of the licenses authorises, with certain limitations and exclusions, U.S. persons to engage in transactions and activities ordinarily incident and necessary to
the maintenance or wind down of operations, contracts,
or other agreements (including the importation of goods,
services, or technology onto the US) involving the Group
(“License 12”).The other license authorises, with certain limitations and exclusions, U.S. persons to engage in
transactions and activities ordinarily incident and necessary to divest or transfer to a non-U.S. person, or to facilitate the transfer by a non-U.S. person to another non-U.S.

Shareholders only, which has not been amended since the
Listing Date, sets out certain agreed matters between the

10 MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

11 CONNECTED TRANSACTIONS
The transactions and arrangements summarised below
were entered into by members of the Group with its connected persons (including their respective associates)
prior to and during the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December
2017, and are required to be disclosed by the Company in
compliance with Rules 14A.49, 14A.71 and 14A.72 of the
Listing Rules and, where applicable, were disclosed by the
Company in accordance with the requirements of Chapter
14A of the Listing Rules.

Continuing connected transactions disclosed in
the Directors’ Report section of the Annual Report diﬀer
from the related party transaction disclosures included in
note 5, note 6 and note 25 of the consolidation ﬁnancial
statements. Diﬀerences arise as the deﬁnition of continuing connected transactions does not include operations
with Glencore or operations with associates of the Group,
while these transactions are treated as related party
transactions in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of
the Group. Additionally, transactions that are considered
immaterial and meet the deﬁnition of de minimis under
Rule 14A.76(1) of the Listing Rules are not included in the
disclosure of continuing connected transactions.
The independent non-executive Directors consider that each of the transactions below have been
entered into and are conducted:
(a)

in the ordinary and usual course of business of the
Group;

(b)

on normal commercial terms or better; and

(c)

in accordance with the relevant agreement governing them on terms that are fair and reasonable and in
the interests of the Company and its shareholders as
a whole.

(d)

The Company’s auditors were engaged to report on
the Group’s continuing connected transactions for
the year ended 31 December 2017 in accordance
with the Hong Kong Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 “Assurance Engagements Other Than
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”
and with reference to Practice Note 740 “Auditor’s
Letter on Continuing Connected Transactions under
the Hong Kong Listing Rules” issued by the Hong
Kong Institute of Certiﬁed Public Accountants. The
Board conﬁrmed that auditors have issued an unqualiﬁed letter in accordance with Rule 14A.56, containing their conﬁrmation that nothing has come to their
attention that caused them to believe that the continuing connected transactions as disclosed by the

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

Group in the annual report (i) have not been approved
by the Board; (ii) were not, in all material respects,
in accordance with the pricing policies of the Group
if the transactions involve the provision of goods or
services by the Group; (iii) were not entered into, in
all material respects, in accordance with the relevant
agreement governing the transactions; and (iv) have
exceeded the cap.

Interests in the shares of associated corporations of UC RUSAL
As at 31 December 2017, Mr. Oleg Deripaska,

16 DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN
BUSINESSES THAT MAY COMPETE WITH THE
COMPANY
Mr. Deripaska, Mr. Vladislav Soloviev, (served as a member of the board of directors of En+ from 1 January 2018
until 30 April 2018 and as the CEO of En+ from 15 March
2018 until 30 April 2018), Ms. Gulzhan Moldazhanova, Mr.
Maxim Sokov and Ms. Olga Mashkovskaya were interested
in/were directors of En+, Mr. Ivan Glasenberg (ceased to
be a Director with eﬀect from 10 April 2018) was interested in Glencore and was a director and the chief executive oﬃcer of Glencore. En+, SUAL Partners and Glencore
are businesses which compete or are likely to compete,
either directly or indirectly, with the Company. The summary below provides a description of these businesses, as
well as facts demonstrating that UC RUSAL is capable of
carrying on its own business independently of and at arm’s
length from these businesses.

171

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

In considering whether the Board and senior
management of the Company are independent from the
senior management of each of En+, SUAL Partners and
Glencore, the Directors have taken into account the following general reasons, as well as the speciﬁc reasons
applicable to each of En+, SUAL Partners and Glencore:
(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

as at the Latest Practicable Date the Board consists
of fourteen Directors, comprising two executive
Directors, seven non-executive Directors and ﬁve
independent non-executive Directors;
the decision-making mechanism of the Board set out
in the Articles of Association provides that all Directors with a conﬂicting interest shall not vote when a
conﬂicted resolution is to be discussed and voted on;
the Board has ﬁve independent non-executive
Directors with extensive corporate governance and
ﬁnancial experience and is able to review, enhance
and implement measures to manage any conﬂict of
interests between the businesses in which the Directors have interests and the Group in order to protect
minority shareholders’ interests and to manage the
aﬀairs of the Group independently of the businesses
in which the Directors have interests that may compete with the Company. The independent non-executive Directors make recommendations on proposed
connected transactions by the Company. A committee of the independent non-executive Directors will
make recommendations to the independent shareholders on how to vote for any resolution that relates
to future connected transactions pursuant to the
Listing Rules’ requirements; and
all connected transactions which are subject to
reporting and announcement requirements under
the Listing Rules have to be reviewed by the Audit
Committee before they are approved by the Board.
In respect of each speciﬁc relevant business:
A.

En+

En+ is a public company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Jersey with its registered oﬃce
at 44 Esplanade St. Helier, JE4 9WG, Channel Islands and

a tax resident of Cyprus from 18th December 2017. En+
is ultimately controlled by one of its beneﬁcial owners Mr.
Deripaska, who indirectly held 76.36% of the shares in En+
as at 31 December 2017.
En+ is a leading international vertically integrated
aluminium and power producer. En+ is the world’s largest
privately-held hydro power generator and the largest aluminium producer outside of China.
En+ is focus on electricity generation businesses
and specialises in metals that require high energy consumption. En+ looks for synergies between its energy producing and energy consuming businesses.
En+’s strategy is to optimise the electricity supply-demand balance through the integration of UC RUSAL
and its energy assets.
Key assets of En+ include:
En+ operates through two major business segments:
Energy and Metals.
Energy predominantly consists of the following operating activities: (i) power and heat generation; (ii)
power trading and supply and engineering services; as well
as (iii) power transmission and distribution. Other activities include coal and logistics operations that primarily
support power operations, as well as KraMZ (aluminium
metallurgical plant) and SMR (molybdenum and ferromolybdenum producer).
En+ operates generating assets with 19.7 GW
of installed electricity capacity, out of which 15.1 GW
accounts for hydro power plants, three of which are among
top-20 hydro power plants globally in terms of installed
capacity and with 17.0 kGcal/h of installed heat capacity.
UC RUSAL – one of the largest producers of aluminium and alumina in the world with fully integrated value
chain from bauxite mining to primary aluminium production. Core aluminium producing facilities are located in
Siberia enjoying access to clean environmentally friendly
hydro power. UC RUSAL is one of the lowest cost aluminium producers globally, beneﬁting from cheap, clean and
renewable hydro energy in Siberia.

172

Independence from En+
Having considered all relevant factors, including the following, the Directors are satisﬁed that the Group can conduct its business independently of En+:

Independence of the Board and the Group’s Senior Management from the Senior Management of En+
The majority of the Board currently comprises of
non-executive Directors due to a historical arrangement
between En+, SUAL Partners, Glencore and Onexim, pursuant to which they are each entitled to nominate a certain
number of candidates for appointment as Directors. As at
the Latest Practicable Date, nine of the Directors were
nominated by En+, ﬁve of whom are also directors of En+.
The overlapping Directors at the Latest Practicable Date
were Mr. Soloviev (being executive director of En+ until 30
April 2018 when his resignation from the board of directors of En+ becomes eﬀective), Mr. Deripaska, Mr. Sokov,
Ms. Mashkovskaya and Ms. Moldazhanova. All of the overlapping Directors have been elected on the basis of their
qualiﬁcations and breadth of experience, as set out in further details in the “Proﬁles of Directors and Senior Management” section in this Annual Report. The Company’s
non-executive Directors attend Board meetings and provide guidance to and decide on the Company’s important
matters. Certain of the non-executive Directors also sit
on the committees of the Board and are responsible for
the matters related to such committees. For the general
reasons stated above, the Directors are of the view that
the Group is able to operate independently from En+, notwithstanding the fact that nine Directors are nominated
by En+.

Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its
businesses, and operates as a business group which is
separate from and fully independent of En+.
The Group has, as disclosed under the section
entitled “Connected Transactions” of this Annual Report,
entered into contracts with companies controlled by Mr.
Deripaska for the purchase of electricity, and may continue to do so in the future.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

As aluminium production is energy intensive,
access to relatively inexpensive Siberian hydropower is
central to the competitive strategy of the Group. However, notwithstanding the volume of such purchases from
companies owned and controlled by Mr. Deripaska and the
importance of electricity costs to the production activities
of the Group, the Company does not consider that it is, as
a consequence, overly reliant on Mr. Deripaska for the following reasons:
(a)

the Group has access to alternative sources of electricity as the Group’s Russian smelters are connected
to the Russian power grid, meaning that electricity
supplies can be obtained from various power plants,
all of which are also connected to the grid. These
supplies are available to the Group at market prices;

(b)

the Group purchases electricity in accordance with
the Rules of the Wholesale Electricity and Capacity
Market at contract prices in accordance with direct
sale-purchase agreements with suppliers (both
related or unrelated to the Controlling Shareholder)
and/or at market prices for electricity sold on the
market irrelative to the particular supplier. In 2017,
the overall share of electricity purchased by the
Group’s aluminium plants from the suppliers related
to the Controlling Shareholder did not exceed 59%.
The Group has an option of switching to suppliers
unrelated to the Controlling Shareholder including
by purchasing electricity on the wholesale electricity
market, though there would be certain price impact;

(c)

none of the contracts is in take-or-pay format;

(d)

the Group is currently already a very large volume
user with signiﬁcant negotiating power in the Russian power market. In 2017, the Group has consumed
approximately 29% of the power generated in Siberia; and

173

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

(e)

the power plants owned or controlled by Mr. Deripaska are located in remote regions where there is
a limited number of large volume users located in
proximity to such plants. Sales to distant users would
involve signiﬁcant transmission losses and, because
Siberia is a surplus energy producer, the result is that
these plants are more reliant on the customer rather
than vice versa.

Financial Independence
The Group’s ﬁnancial auditing system is independent from En+ and employs a suﬃcient number of
dedicated ﬁnancial accounting personnel responsible for
ﬁnancial auditing of the Group’s accounts. The Company
has independent bank accounts and independent tax registration. The Group’s treasury operations are handled by
the Company’s treasury department, whose functions
include ﬁnancing, treasury and cash managements and
which operates independently from En+ and shares no
functions or resources with En+. The Group’s choice of
ﬁnancial institutions is mainly based on the credit standing of the institutions and the terms oﬀered by them. As
at the year end of 2017, En+ had not provided any security
and/or guarantee over the Group’s borrowings. As a result
of the above analysis, the Directors believe that the Group
is able to maintain ﬁnancial independence from En+.

CEAC’s (En+’s subsidiary) main asset was KAP, an
aluminum smelter located in Podgorica, Montenegro. KAP
was declared bankrupt in July 2013. All production assets
of KAP (including the smelter) were sold to a Montenegrin company Uniprom. Therefore, CEAC is currently not
involved in any aluminum or bauxite business and may not
be regarded as a competitor of UC RUSAL.
Mr. Deripaska is a beneﬁcial owner of 76.36%
shares of En+, the substantial shareholder of the KraMZ
group of companies. Most of the KraMZ plant’s raw materials (principally aluminium) are purchased from companies within the Group (primarily KrAZ). KraMZ’s main customers are industrial customers located within Russia and
abroad that purchase aluminium rods, proﬁles, tubes and
cast aluminium alloys.
B. SUAL Partners

Extent of Competition

SUAL Partners is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Bahamas whose registered
oﬃce is at 2nd Terrace West, Centreville, Nassau, Commonwealth of the Bahamas. SUAL Partners is beneﬁcially
owned by a number of individuals, with Mr. Len Blavatnik
(who ceased to be a non-executive Director on 10 November 2016) being a shareholder of SUAL Partners as to more
than 30% of the total issued share capital. SUAL Partners
is a holding company that holds interests in the Company
and a separate kitchenware and houseware business.

The only En+ businesses which compete with or
are likely to compete with the Group’s business, either
directly or indirectly, are those excluded businesses
described below. However, by reason of the nature of such
excluded businesses and the clear delineation between
the Group’s business and such excluded business, the
Group is fully capable of carrying on its business independently of and at arm’s length from such excluded business.

The Group has, as disclosed under the section
entitled “Connected Transactions” of this Annual Report,
entered into contracts with companies controlled by SUAL
Partners for aluminium sales, and may continue to do so in
the future. These aluminium sales contracts have been
entered into as part of the ordinary course of business and
pursuant to anti-monopoly requirements on the supply of
aluminium to Russian producers.

There is no real competitive threat to the Group’s
business from the excluded business and there is no intention of the Company to acquire such excluded business.

Independence from SUAL Partners
Having considered all relevant factors, including
the following, the Group is satisﬁed that it can conduct its
business independently of SUAL Partners:

174

Independence of the Board and the Group’s Senior Management from the Senior Management of SUAL Partners
For the general reasons stated above, the Directors are of the view that the Group is able to operate
independently from SUAL Partners because the Group’s
day-to-day operations are managed by three executive
Directors who are independent of and not connected with
SUAL Partners and the senior management team of the
Group are also all independent of and not connected with
SUAL Partners.
Based on the above, the Board is satisﬁed that
the Board as a whole, together with the senior management team, are able to perform their managerial role in the
Group independently from SUAL Partners.

Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its
businesses, and operates as a business group which is
separate from and fully independent of SUAL Partners.

Financial Independence
The Group’s ﬁnancial auditing system is independent from SUAL Partners and employs a suﬃcient number
of dedicated ﬁnancial accounting personnel responsible
for ﬁnancial auditing of the Group’s accounts. The Company has independent bank accounts and independent tax
registration.
The Group’s treasury operations are handled by
the Company’s treasury department, whose functions
include ﬁnancing, treasury and cash management and
which operates independently from SUAL Partners and
shares no functions or resources with SUAL Partners.
The Group’s choice of ﬁnancial institutions is
mainly based on the credit standing of the institutions and
the terms oﬀered by them.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT

As at the year end of 2017, SUAL Partners had not
provided any security and/or guarantee over the Group’s
borrowings.
As a result of the above analysis, the Directors
believe that the Group is ﬁnancially independent from
SUAL Partners.

Extent of Competition
The Board is of the opinion that SUAL Partners is
not a competitor of the Company.
C. Glencore
Amokenga Holdings is a company incorporated in
Bermuda whose registered oﬃce is at 22 Victoria Street,
Canon’s Court, Hamilton, HM12, Bermuda. Amokenga
Holdings is ultimately controlled by Glencore, which is a
public company listed on the London Stock Exchange, with
a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
No individual shareholder controls more than 20% of
the share capital of Glencore. Glencore’s industrial and
marketing activities are supported by a global network
of more than 90 oﬃces located in over 50 countries and
employ around 155,000 people, including contractors. Mr.
Glasenberg is a shareholder, director and chief executive
oﬃcer of Glencore, whose principal business is the production and trading of commodities including aluminium.
Mr. Glasenberg is a non-executive Director of the Company and is also a member of the corporate governance
and nominations committee, the standing committee and
the Norilsk Nickel investment supervisory committee of
the Company. Mr. Glasenberg ceased to be a Director and
a member of the aforementioned committees with eﬀect
from 10 April 2018. As he is not an executive Director, he
does not participate in the day-to-day management of
the Company, and accordingly is not involved in the daily
operations of the aluminium trading division and so does
not have access to conﬁdential contracts entered into by
that division. Notwithstanding that his role on the Board as
a non-executive Director does not require his involvement
in the day-to-day management of the Company, this does
not preclude Mr. Glasenberg from fulﬁlling his ﬁduciary
duties. In case Mr. Glasenberg has a conﬂicting interest,
pursuant to the Articles of Association of the Company, he
shall abstain from voting at Board meetings when a conﬂicted resolution is to be discussed and voted on, subject
to certain exceptions.

175

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

When the Group acquired certain of the alumina
businesses of Glencore in late March 2007, it became subject to a contract for the supply of alumina to Glencore that
continued through 2008, in declining amounts. The Group
sold to Glencore approximately 29.51% of its excess alumina in monetary terms in 2017. The Company also has
long term supply contracts with Glencore for alumina and
primary aluminium, and Glencore was the Group’s largest
customer of alumina and primary aluminium in the ﬁnancial
year, accounting for approximately 29.20% of the Group’s
sales of primary aluminium.
Independence from Glencore
Having considered all relevant factors, including the following, the Group is satisﬁed that it can conduct its business independently of Glencore:

Independence of the Board and the Group’s Senior Management from the Senior Management of Glencore
For the general reasons stated above, the Directors are of the view that the Group is able to operate
independently from Glencore notwithstanding that one
Director is also a director of Glencore because the Group’s
day-to-day operations are managed by three executive
Directors and the senior management team who are independent of and not connected with Glencore.
Based on the above, the Board is satisﬁed that
the Board as a whole, together with the senior management team, are able to perform their managerial role in the
Group independently.

Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its
businesses, and operates as a business group which is
separate from and fully independent of Glencore.

1.

Represents Glencore’s economic interest, comprising 42.9 per cent. voting interest and 4.5 per
cent. non-voting interest.

Financial Independence
The Group’s ﬁnancial auditing system is independent from Glencore and employs a suﬃcient number of
dedicated ﬁnancial accounting personnel responsible for
ﬁnancial auditing of the Group’s accounts. The Company
has independent bank accounts and independent tax registration.
The Group’s treasury operations are handled by
the Company’s treasury department, whose functions
include ﬁnancing, treasury and cash management and
which operates independently from Glencore and shares
no functions or resources with Glencore.
The Group’s choice of ﬁnancial institutions is
mainly based on the credit standing of the institutions and
the terms oﬀered by them.
As at the year end of 2017, Glencore had not
provided any security and/or guarantee over the Group’s
borrowings. As a result of the above analysis, the Directors believe that the Group is ﬁnancially independent from
Glencore.

Extent of Competition
Glencore participates in the marketing of both
aluminium and alumina from world markets as well as from
industrial assets in which it has an interest. Glencore has
an economic interest of 47.4%1 in Century Aluminium
Company, a NASDAQ-quoted company. Century owns and
operates three aluminium smelters in the United States, in
Hawesville, Kentucky (the Hawesville aluminium smelter),
Robards, Kentucky (the Sebree aluminium smelter) and
Goose Creek, South Carolina (the Mt. Holly aluminium
smelter), and one aluminium smelter in Grundartangi, Iceland (the Grundartangi aluminium smelter). Glencore, in its
business of trading, is also a customer of the Group.

all Directors (save and except for Mr. Ivan Glasenberg, Mr.
Philip Lader, Mr. Daniel Lesin Wolfe, and Mr. Maksim Goldman, who resigned as Directors due to the OFAC Sanctions with eﬀect from 10 April 2018) conﬁrmed that they

the section headed Proﬁles of Directors and Senior Management on page 93 of this Annual Report.
(b) Term of appointment of Directors

non-executive Directors signed an appointment letter
with the Company providing for the same three years

that if any Director has at the start of the annual general
meeting been in oﬃce for three years or more since his
last appointment or re-appointment, he shall retire at the
annual general meeting. As such, it is possible that a director may be in oﬃce for more than three years depending

C O R P O RAT E G OV E R N A N C E R E P O RT

The primary role of the executive committee is
to assist the Chief Executive Oﬃcer and senior management with the day-to-day management of the Group and
to assist the Board in formulating and implementing the
strategy of the Group and monitoring its performance.
Additional duties and responsibilities of the executive committee include, but are not limited to, developing
Group strategy for Board approval and implementing such
strategy once approved, reviewing and opining on any
matter involving expenditure of more than USD75 million
before referring such matter to the Board, and overseeing
and monitoring the ﬁnancial performance of the Group.
In addition, the executive committee is empowered to
establish committees comprising of its members, as well
as other managers from time to time.
The executive committee meets as frequently as
necessary, but not less than twice per month. The executive committee operates as the management board of
RUSAL Global Management B.V. The Chief Executive Oﬃcer formally reports the decisions and actions of the executive committee to the Board at meetings of the Board.
(e) Board powers to issue shares
The Board has been given authority by the Company’s shareholders to issue Shares. The mandate is
described on page 117 of this Annual Report.
(f) Relationships among members of the Board
Please refer to the proﬁles of Directors and
Senior Management for more information about the relationships among members of the Board.
(g) Shareholders’ Agreements
The Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company
and the Shareholders’ Agreement between Major Shareholders were both entered into on 22 January 2010 and
are still in force. For brief details of these shareholders’
agreements, please see Appendix A and Appendix B.
(h) Shareholder Options
The Glencore Call Option granted by Glencore to
En+ and SUAL Partners to acquire all Shares held by Glencore lapsed on 26 March 2017.

(i) Board meetings at which Directors have material interests
A.1.7 of the CG Code states that “If a substantial shareholder or a director has a conﬂict of interest in
a matter to be considered by the board which the board
has determined to be material, the matter should be dealt
with by a physical board meeting rather than a written resolution. Independent non-executive directors who, and
whose close associates, have no material interest in the
transaction should be present at that board meeting.”
The Board generally endeavoured throughout the
twelve-month period ended 31 December 2017 to ensure
that it did not deal with business by the way of written resolution where a substantial Shareholder of the Company
or an independent non-executive Director had disclosed
an interest in a matter to be considered by the Board
which the Board determined to be material. As a result,
there were only two occurrences (out of the thirty two
written resolutions the Board passed during the period)
when urgent business was dealt with by the Board by way
of written resolution where a material interest of a Director was stated to have been disclosed. In each of those
instances, the interest of the independent non-executive
Director was a potential conﬂict of interest by virtue of the
fact that an independent non-executive Director was also
a member of the supervisory council for the parent company of the entity contracting with the Company.
On those occurrences, the written resolutions
were passed by the requisite majority excluding the materially interested Director.
10 Board meetings were held in the twelve
month period ended 31 December 2017. With the exception of three of the Board meetings held, where certain
independent non-executives were not present, all the
independent non-executive Directors were present at the
Board meetings held in the twelve month period ended 31
December 2017 where one or more Director(s) had disclosed a material interest.
Of the 10 Board meetings held, there were three
occasions where an independent non-executive Director had a material interest in the transaction. On such
occurrences, the independent non-executive Director abstained from voting and the resolutions approving
entry into such transactions were passed by the requisite
majority excluding the materially interested independent
non-executive Director.

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

4. CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
The roles of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief
Executive Oﬃcer are segregated and are independent to
each other. The Chairman (being Mr. Matthias Warnig) is
chieﬂy responsible for maintaining the eﬀective operation
of the Board. The Chairman is also responsible for chairing Board meetings, brieﬁng Board members on issues
discussed at Board meetings and ensuring good corporate
governance practices and procedures are established.
The role as Chief Executive Oﬃcer is primarily concerned
with the supervision of the execution of the policies determined by the Board particularly in the areas of production
and supply chain, ﬁnancial management and corporate
ﬁnance, sales and marketing and others. The Company has
approved a policy statement setting out those responsibilities to be undertaken by the Chairman and those to be
undertaken by the Chief Executive Oﬃcer. The Chairman
is responsible for leadership of the Board and for creating
the conditions necessary to allow the Board and individual
Directors to operate eﬀectively. The Chief Executive Oﬃcer is responsible for the day to day management of the
Group and ensuring that the strategic decisions made by
the Board are implemented.

5. INDEPENDENT NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules requires that an issuer
must appoint independent non-executive directors representing at least one-third of the board. The current
composition of the Board represents an appropriate mix
of Directors which oﬀers suﬃcient independent checks
and balances and an appropriate governance structure for
the Company. As at the Latest Practicable Date, the Company had 5 out of 14 Directors who are independent nonexecutive Directors, and there is no change in the shareholders’ agreement in relation to Board nominations/
appointments (as described on pages 287 and 288 of the
Company’s prospectus dated 31 December 2009).

191

The Board believes that all independent nonexecutive Directors have appropriate and suﬃcient industry or ﬁnance experience and qualiﬁcations to carry out
their duties so as to protect the interests of shareholders
of the Company. Each of the independent non-executive
Directors has undertaken to inform the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission as
soon as practicable if there is any subsequent change of
circumstances which may aﬀect their independence. The
Company has received from each of the independent nonexecutive Directors (save and except for Mr. Philip Lader,
who resigned as a Director with eﬀect from 10 April 2018
due to the OFAC Sanctions) an annual conﬁrmation of
independence pursuant to Rule 3.13 of the Listing Rules.
To the best knowledge of the Board, all the independent
non-executive Directors were independent during the
Review Period by reference to the factors stated in the
Listing Rules.

6. NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS AND THE
WORK OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Company established a corporate governance and
nomination committee with written terms of reference in
compliance with the CG Code.
The primary functions of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee are, among other
things, to develop, recommend and annually review corporate governance guidelines, policies and practices for
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, to oversee corporate governance matters, to review and monitor the training and continuous professional development
of Directors and senior management, to develop, review
and monitor the Company's code of conduct and compliance manual and applicable to employees and Directors,
reviewing the Company’s compliance with the CG Code
set out in Appendix 14 of the Listing Rules and disclosure
in the Corporate Governance Report, and to make recommendations to the Board, including those in relation to
the appointment and removal of Directors. The Corporate
Governance and Nomination Committee is provided with
suﬃcient resources to discharge its duties and its terms of
reference also permit it to obtain access to a legal adviser.

192

C O R P O RAT E G OV E R N A N C E R E P O RT

In recommending a candidate for appointment
to the Board, the Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee is required to determine criteria, objectives
and procedures for selecting Board members, including
factors such as independence (in the case of independent non-executive directors), diversity, age, future succession planning, integrity, skills, expertise, experience,
knowledge about the Company’s business and industry,
and willingness to devote adequate time and eﬀort to
Board responsibilities. In identifying suitable candidates
the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee is
required to use open advertising or the services of external advisers to facilitate the search, consider candidates
from a wide range of backgrounds and consider candidates on merit against objective criteria, taking care that
appointees have enough time to devote to the position.
The Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee consists of a majority of independent nonexecutive Directors. During the Review Period, the composition of the Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee was as follows:
Mr. Philip Lader
(chairman of the committee, independent nonexecutive Director)
Dr. Bernard Zonneveld
(independent non-executive Director)
Mr. Mark Garber
(independent non-executive Director)
Mr. Ivan Glasenberg
(non-executive Director)
Ms. Ekaterina Nikitina
(non-executive Director)

The members of the Corporate Governance
and Nomination Committee have regularly attended and
actively participated in meetings. For the attendance
record of the meetings held by the Corporate Governance
and Nomination Committee during 2017, please refer to
paragraph 3(a) of this Corporate Governance Report.
According to the Articles of Association, at every
annual general meeting, one-third of the Directors or, if
their number is not three or a multiple of three, the number nearest to one-third shall retire from oﬃce; but if any
Director has at the start of the annual general meeting
been in oﬃce for three years or more since his last appointment or reappointment, he shall retire at the annual general meeting. The Directors to retire by rotation shall be,
ﬁrst, those who wish to retire and not be re-appointed
to oﬃce and, second, those who have been longest in
oﬃce since their last appointment or re-appointment. As
between persons who became or were last re-appointed
directors on the same day, those to retire shall (unless
they otherwise agree among themselves) be determined
by lot. The details of the Directors who will retire and oﬀer
themselves for re-election at the forthcoming annual general meeting are set out in the relevant circular issued by
the Company.
The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee
also monitors the implementation of the Board Diversity Policy of the Company. The Company recognises
and embraces the beneﬁts of having a diverse Board to
enhance the quality of its performance. The current mix of
skills, experience and other diversity criteria of directors,
including but not limited to sex, age, nationality and educational background, provides for a balanced composition
of the Board.

7. INFORMATION RELATING TO THE
REMUNERATION POLICY AND THE WORK OF
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Company has established a remuneration committee with written terms of reference in compliance with
the CG Code. The primary functions of the Remuneration Committee are, among other things, to make recommendations to the Board on the remuneration package of
the Directors and senior management, and to assist the
Board in overseeing the administration of the Company’s
compensation and beneﬁts plans. Remuneration policies
are determined on the basis of an employee’s qualiﬁcations and performance, as well as the complexity of his or
her job. Wages for each employee are generally reviewed

eﬀectiveness of the Company’s ﬁnancial reporting process, risk management and internal control systems, and
internal audit function, to oversee the audit process and to
perform other duties and responsibilities as are assigned
to the Audit Committee by the Board. The Audit Committee is assisted by the Company’s internal audit function which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of
risk management, internal controls and procedures, the
results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee consists of a majority of

legal requirements and that adequate disclosures have
been made. Minutes of Audit Committee meetings are
taken, recorded and kept.
The Audit Committee reviews the Company’s
ﬁnancial and accounting policies and practices, meets the
external auditors on a regular basis, and reviews all related
party transactions before the Board’s consideration. The
Audit Committee also reviews the Company’s ﬁnancial
controls, internal control and risk management system,
and the Company’s internal audit function.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors acknowledge that it is their responsibility

aﬀairs of the Group and of the results and cash ﬂow for
that period.
The Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires the
Directors to prepare consolidated ﬁnancial statements
for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view of
the state of aﬀairs of the Company and its subsidiaries and
of the proﬁt or loss of the Company and its subsidiaries
for that period. In preparing these consolidated ﬁnancial
statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and apply
them consistently;
make judgments and estimates which are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable accounting standards
have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements; and
prepare the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.

198

C O R P O RAT E G OV E R N A N C E R E P O RT

The directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company
and enable them to ensure that the consolidated ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law
1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The Chief Financial Oﬃcer of the Group is
required to regularly present and explain to the Audit
Committee and the Board reports on the Group’s ﬁnancial
position and operating results, and report other matters
that may have a material impact upon the ﬁnancial performance and operations in order that the Audit Committee
and the Board may make informed decisions.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS. The reporting responsibility of the external auditors of the Company on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group are set out in the independent auditors’ report on pages 205 to 211 of this Annual
Report.

11. RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL
CONTROL
The Company’s risk management and internal control systems have been designed to achieve strategic objectives
of the Company, safeguard the assets of the Company,
determine the nature and extent of the risks, maintain
proper accounting records, ensure execution with appropriate authority and compliance with relevant laws and
regulations. The risk management system has always represented the core part of the Company’s internal control
system, however it has become of even greater importance due to the increased level of uncertainty and volatility on global markets. The Board fully acknowledges its
responsibility to establish and maintain appropriate and
eﬀective risk management and internal control systems
that are designed to achieve the Company’s strategic
objectives based on compliance with the risk appetite of
shareholders alongside with interests of other stakeholders.

1.

The Directorate for Control acts under the service agreement between UC Rusal Plc and Rusal
Global Management B.V.

In accordance with CG Code provision C.2.1., the
Board reviews the Company’s risk management and internal control systems on a quarterly basis to ensure their
eﬀectiveness. The Company has an internal audit function
in the bounds of the Directorate for Control, internal audit
and business coordination (here in after referred to as the
Directorate for Control1) and Audit Committee that carry
out the analysis and independent appraisal of the adequacy and eﬀectiveness of the Group’s risk management
and internal control systems.
The Board and the Directorate for Control provide assurance in terms of adequacy of resources, staﬀ
qualiﬁcations and experience, training programs and budgets of the core functions of the Group such as accounting, internal audit and ﬁnancial reporting. There is a risk
management group within the Directorate for control,
which is responsible for developing and monitoring the
Company’s risk management policies. The risk management group includes employees that are appropriately
qualiﬁed to manage ﬁnancial, operational and compliance
risks. The Directorate for Control reports regularly to the
Board on its activities including those related to the risk
management system.
The Company aims to promote a risk-based
thinking among all its employees including all the management layers and those directly engaged in the production
process. The Company’s risk management policies, that
are designed to identify, analyze and manage the risks,
are delivered to relevant employees so that they could
understand the coherence between their responsibilities and the risks faced by the Group as a whole. Thus, all
the Group risks are consolidated in the Risk Map of the
Group that is being monitored by all the management layers and responsible employees are allocated to each risk.
The Directorate for Control considers risk management
instruments to be applied for each risk. Annual insurance
program is developed based on the risk map of the Group.
In respect of potentially risky instruments, such as hedging of commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates, require special approval by the hedge
committee of the Company. Such a transparent attitude to
risk management improves risk awareness of employees
including understanding of appropriate risk limits, relevant
controls and instruments to monitor risks, adherence
to risk limits alongside with the ability to respond to the
changes of the business environment on a timely basis.

199

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

The Company’s Audit Committee oversees how
management monitors compliance with the Company’s
risk management policies and procedures and reviews the
adequacy of the risk management framework in relation
to the risks faced by the Company. The Company’s Audit
Committee is assisted in its oversight role by the Company’s internal audit function, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and
procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit
Committee.
The Board, the Company’s Audit Committee and
the Directorate for Control aim to ensure that the internal control capability is regularly improved and enhanced.
However it is important to note that the Company’s internal control and risk management system are designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or
loss.

Financial Controls
The Company’s risk management and internal
control systems are eﬀective in terms of ﬁnancial controls
as the Board fully acknowledges its responsibility to provide stakeholders with true and fair ﬁnancial statements
which reﬂect all the material aspects of the Company
aﬀairs and thus might be used for reasonable decisions.
The ﬁnancial reporting function is regularly audited by the
Directorate for Control and external auditors to prevent
material misstatement due to fraud or error. The Board
aims to increase the level of automation of the ﬁnancial reporting function on an on-going basis to increase
eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of ﬁnancial controls of the
Company. The Board ensures that ﬁnancial controls of
the Company are strong and based on best practice patterns. Financial controls are checked in the bounds of all
the audits and revisions performed by the Directorate for
Control.
Compliance Controls

The results of the Board’s quarterly reviews of
the Company’s risk management and internal control system during the year 2017 are as follows:
Operational Controls
Operational controls are established for management of a wide range of risks, including those related to
the production process, procurement, cash ﬂow management, foreign currency exchange rates, fraud, competitors, politics etc. (i.e. other than those related to compliance and ﬁnancial reporting), covering the core scope of
the Directorate for Control. The Audit Committee issues
an annual plan of audits and revisions to be performed in
12 months. However, unplanned audits and revisions are
performed on a regular basis to guarantee that operational controls are eﬀective and eﬃcient. The operational
controls system is based on either best practice patterns
or recommendations of audits and revisions (compliance
to such recommendation is also regularly checked). The
Directorate for Control reports to the Board on results of
audits and revisions on a quarterly basis. During the year
2017 the Directorate for controls assessed all the material
risks identiﬁed and developed relevant risk management
patterns to be applied for them in accordance with the
Company’s risk management policies and risk appetites of
shareholders.

The Company operates in ﬁve continents having
business aﬀairs in many countries all over the globe which
creates a need to comply with various legal requirements
including those related to environment. The Board and
the Directorate for Control acknowledge the importance
to comply with legal and environmental requirements in
order to be a green aluminum manufacturer and a good
corporate citizen. Compliance controls are checked in the
bounds of all the audits and revisions performed by the
Directorate for Control.

Information Disclosure Controls
Since the Company’s listing, it has been subject
to requirements relating to continuous disclosure obligations, including determination and disclosure of inside
information. In the beginning of 2010, the Board delegated
its authority to assess whether information constitutes
inside information, whether it is subject to immediate
disclosure or whether any safe harbor provisions may
apply; to determine the timing and format of disclosure;
to appoint oﬃcers responsible for collection, preliminary
analysis and processing of the information within various
business subdivisions of the Group; to appoint the Company’s authorized representatives to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange; and to decide on trading halts and other issues
to be raised with the disclosure committee. At the same
time, internal policy regulating the treatment of inside
information was adopted within the Group.

The internal control system applied in the Group
with respect to inside information ensures that any piece
of information that may constitute inside information
is promptly escalated to the disclosure committee and,
should it constitute inside information, is disclosed. Disclosure of inside information is made through the tools
available to the Company under applicable legislation in
every jurisdiction where the Company is subject to such
disclosure (e.g. via the Hong Kong Stock Exchange webpage in Hong Kong, Businesswire agency in France and
Interfax agency in Russia).
It is important to note that the Directorate for
Control did not identify in the year 2017 any signiﬁcant
violations of operational, ﬁnancial or compliance controls
and any signiﬁcant risks such as those that may potentially
give rise to uncertainties about ability of the Company to
continue to operate as a going concern.

12. RELEVANT OFFICERS’ SECURITIES
TRANSACTIONS
The Company has also adopted a code for Securities Transactions by Relevant Oﬃcers of the Company (the “Relevant Oﬃcers Code”). The Relevant Oﬃcers Code was
based on Appendix 10 to the Listing Rules but it was made
more exacting. It was also based on the requirements of
the French Monetary and Financial Code, Chapters II and
III of Title II of Book II of the General Regulation of the AMF
and Titles II and III of Book VI of the General Regulation of
the AMF with respect to insider dealing and market misconduct. It applies to any employee of the Company or a
director or employee of a subsidiary of the Company who,
because of such oﬃce or employment, is likely to be in
possession of unpublished price sensitive information in
relation to the Company or its securities. The Relevant
Oﬃcers Code was adopted by the Board on 9 April 2010.

202

C O R P O RAT E G OV E R N A N C E R E P O RT

INDEPENDENT
AUDITOR’S
REPORT

To the Members of United Company RUSAL Plc

OPINION
We have audited the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of
United Company RUSAL Plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated
statement of ﬁnancial position as at 31 December 2017,
the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in equity and cash ﬂows for the year then
ended, and notes, comprising signiﬁcant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated ﬁnancial position of the Group as at 31 December 2017, and its consolidated ﬁnancial performance and
its consolidated cash ﬂows for the year then ended in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), and have been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and
the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies
Ordinance.

208

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”). Our responsibilities under
those standards are further described in the Auditors’
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent
of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants (“IESBA Code”), and we have
fulﬁlled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance
with the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence
we have obtained is suﬃcient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

OTHER MATTER
In our report dated 22 February 2018, we expressed an
opinion on the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements
as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 that
was qualiﬁed for the eﬀect of such adjustments, if any,
that might have been determined to be necessary had
we been able to obtain suﬃcient and appropriate audit
evidence in relation to the Group’s estimate of the share
of proﬁt, other comprehensive income and foreign
currency translation gain of the Group’s equity investee,
PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel (“Norilsk Nickel”) for the year
ended 31 December 2017, and the carrying value of the
Group’s investment in Norilsk Nickel as at 31 December
2017.

Since that date as described in Note 15, the Directors
have obtained the required information and have concluded that no adjustment to the Group’s accounting for
the Norilsk Nickel investment is required. We have audited
the above information and concluded that it has been
properly applied. Accordingly our present report on the
Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements as at and for
the year ended 31 December 2017, as presented herein
and approved by the Board of Directors on 13 March 2018,
is diﬀerent from our previous report dated 22 February
2018.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signiﬁcance in our audit
of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the current
period. These matters were addressed in the context of
our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as a
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Valuation of property, plant and equipment

209

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

Please refer to the note 13 in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
THE KEY AUDIT MATTER

HOW THE MATTER WAS ADDRESSED IN OUR AUDIT

The Group has significant property, plant
and equipment balance which is material to
the consolidated financial statements as at
31 December 2017. Current global market
conditions, including continuing growth in
LME aluminium prices, may indicate that
some previously impaired property, plant
and equipment items may demonstrate a
need for reversal of impairment. This is in
particular related to such cash generating
unit (“CGUs”) as Windalco.
As at the reporting date management
performs valuation of the recoverable
amount of the Group’s assets and cash
generating units as their value in use.
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved
in forecasting and discounting future
cash flows, which are the basis of the
assessment of recoverability, this is one of
the key judgmental areas that our audit is
concentrated on.

For aluminium, alumina and bauxite CGUs we evaluated the reasonableness of the expected
cash flow forecasts by comparing them with the latest budgets approved by the Board of
Directors, externally derived data as well as our own assessments in relation to key inputs such
as production levels, forecasted aluminium sales prices, forecasted alumina purchase prices,
costs inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, discount rates and terminal growth rates.
We also considered the historic accuracy of management’s forecasts by comparing prior year
forecasts to actual results.
We used our own valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the assumptions and
methodology used by the Group.
In particular, we challenged:
–
aluminium and alumina smelters costs projections by comparing them with historical
results and industry peers;
–
the key assumptions for long term revenue growth rates in the forecasts by comparing
them with historical results, economic and industry forecasts; and
–
the discount rates used. Specifically, we recalculated the Group’s weighted average
cost of capital using market comparable information.
We also performed sensitivity analysis on the discounted cash flow forecasts and assessed
whether the Group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment
assessment to changes in key assumptions, including forecasted aluminium and alumina
prices and discount rates, reflected the risks inherent in the valuation of property, plant and
equipment.

OTHER INFORMATION
The Directors are responsible for the other information.
The other information comprises the information included
in the Group’s Annual Report but does not include the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements and our auditors’ report
thereon. The Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report.
Our opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements does
not cover the other information and we will not express
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identiﬁed above when it becomes available and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated ﬁnancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS AND
THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with IFRS, the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991
and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the
Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the
Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no
realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s ﬁnancial reporting process.

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE
AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis
of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we
exercise professional judgment and maintain professional
scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design
and perform audit procedures responsive to
those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
suﬃcient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control
relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the eﬀectiveness of the Group’s
internal control.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures
made by the Directors.
Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,
whether a material uncertainty exists related
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our auditors’ report to the related
disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date
of our auditors’ report. However, future events
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to
continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure
and content of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether
the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in
a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence
regarding the ﬁnancial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the
direction, supervision and performance of the
group audit. We remain solely responsible for
our audit opinion.

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned
scope and timing of the audit and signiﬁcant audit ﬁndings, including any signiﬁcant deﬁciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY
REQUIREMENTS
Matter on which we are required to report by exception.

We also provide those charged with governance
with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence,
and where applicable, related safeguards.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991
requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

From the matters communicated with those
charged with governance, we determine those matters
that were of most signiﬁcance in the audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the current period and
are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these
matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation
precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in
extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest beneﬁts of such
communication.

returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

adequate accounting records have not been
kept by the Company; or

the financial statements of the company are
not in agreement with the accounting records;
or
we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit.

Related party transactions are disclosed in note 25.

(b)

Deconsolidation and disposal of subsidiaries

In July 2016 the Group entered into an agreement to sell its 100% stake in the Alumina Partners of
Jamaica (“Alpart”) to the Chinese state industrial group,
JIUQUAN IRON & STEEL (GROUP) Co. Ltd. (“JISCO”) for
a consideration of USD299 million. In November 2016 the
Group completed the sale of Alpart and received the full
consideration in cash.
(c)

Operations

The Group operates in the aluminium industry primarily in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Guinea,
Jamaica, Ireland, Italy, Nigeria and Sweden and is principally engaged in the mining and reﬁning of bauxite and
nepheline ore into alumina, the smelting of primary aluminium from alumina and the fabrication of aluminium and
aluminium alloys into semi-fabricated and ﬁnished products. The Group sells its products primarily in Europe, Russia, other countries of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (“CIS”), Asia and North America.

228

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

(d)

Business environment in emerging economies

The Russian Federation, Ukraine, Jamaica, Nigeria and Guinea have been experiencing political and economic changes that have aﬀected, and may continue to
aﬀect, the activities of enterprises operating in these environments. Consequently, operations in these countries
involve risks that typically do not exist in other markets,
including reconsideration of privatisation terms in certain
countries where the Group operates following changes in
governing political powers.
The conﬂict in Ukraine and related events has
increased the perceived risks of doing business in the Russian Federation. The imposition of economic sanctions
on Russian individuals and legal entities by the European
Union, the United States of America, Japan, Canada, Australia and others, as well as retaliatory sanctions imposed
by the Russian government, has resulted in increased economic uncertainty including more volatile equity markets,
a depreciation of the Russian Ruble, a reduction in both
local and foreign direct investment inﬂows and a signiﬁcant tightening in the availability of credit. In particular,
some Russian entities may be experiencing diﬃculties in
accessing international equity and debt markets and may
become increasingly dependent on Russian state banks
to ﬁnance their operations. The longer term eﬀects of
recently implemented sanctions, as well as the threat of
additional future sanctions, are diﬃcult to determine.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements reﬂect
management’s assessment of the impact of the Russian,
Ukrainian, Jamaican, Nigerian and Guinean business environments on the operations and the ﬁnancial position of
the Group. The future business environment may diﬀer
from management’s assessment.

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

The IASB has issued the following amendments,
new standards and interpretations which are not yet

eﬀective in respect of the ﬁnancial years included in these
consolidated ﬁnancial statements, and which have not
been adopted in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

IFRS 16, LEASES

1 JANUARY 2019

The Group is required to adopt IFRS 9 Financial
Instruments and IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers from 1 January 2018. The Group has assessed
the estimated impact that the initial application of IFRS 9
and IFRS 15 will have on its consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The Group is in the process of making an assessment of the impact of IFRS 16 on its consolidated ﬁnancial
statements.
Based on preliminary assessment the new Standards IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 are not expected to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
of the Group. The estimated impact of the adoption of
these standards on the Group’s equity as at 1 January
2018 is based on assessments undertaken to date and is
summarised below. The actual impacts of adopting the
standards at 1 January 2018 may change because the new
accounting policies are subject to change until the Group
presents its ﬁrst ﬁnancial statements that include the date
of initial application.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments sets out requirements for
recognising and measuring ﬁnancial assets, ﬁnancial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-ﬁnancial items.
This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

(i) Classiﬁcation - Financial assets
IFRS 9 contains a new classiﬁcation and measurement approach for ﬁnancial assets that reﬂects the
business model in which assets are managed and their
cash ﬂow characteristics.
IFRS 9 contains three principal classiﬁcation categories for ﬁnancial assets: measured at amortized cost,
fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”)
and fair value through proﬁt or loss (“FVTPL”). The standard eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held to
maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale.
Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts
where the host is a ﬁnancial asset in the scope of the standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the hybrid ﬁnancial
instrument as a whole is assessed for classiﬁcation.
Based on its preliminary assessment, the Group
does not believe that the new classiﬁcation requirements
will have a material impact on its accounting for trade
receivables, loans, investments in debt securities.

230

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

(ii) Impairment - Financial assets
IFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS
39 with a forward-looking ‘expected credit loss’ (“ECL”)
model. This will require considerable judgement about
how changes in economic factors aﬀect ECLs, which will
be determined on a probability-weighted basis.
The new impairment model will apply to ﬁnancial
assets measured at amortized cost or FVOCI, except for
investments in equity instruments.
Under IFRS 9, loss allowances will be measured
on either of the following bases:

12-month ECLs . These are ECLs that result
from possible default events within the 12
months after the reporting date; and

Lifetime ECL measurement applies if the credit
risk of a ﬁnancial asset at the reporting date has increased
signiﬁcantly since initial recognition and 12-month ECL
measurement applies if it has not. An entity may determine that a ﬁnancial asset’s credit risk has not increased
signiﬁcantly if the asset has low credit risk at the reporting
date. However, lifetime ECL measurement always applies
for trade receivables without a signiﬁcant ﬁnancing component.
The Group believes that impairment losses are
likely to increase and become more volatile for assets in
the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment model. Based on the
impairment methodology described below, the Group has
preliminary estimated that application of IFRS 9’s impairment requirements at 1 January 2018 would not result in
signiﬁcant additional impairment losses.

lifetime ECLs. These are ECLs that result from
all possible default events over the expected
life of trade receivables.
Trade and other receivables
The estimated ECLs were calculated based on actual
credit loss experience over the past two years.

The following table provides information about
the estimated exposure to credit risk and ECLs for trade
receivables as at 1 January 2018.

Cash and cash equivalents

(iv) Hedge accounting

The cash and cash equivalents are held with bank and
ﬁnancial institution counterparties, which are rated moderate to minimal credit risk as at 31 December 2017.

When initially applying IFRS 9, the Group may
choose as its accounting policy to continue to apply the
hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 instead of the
requirements in IFRS 9. The Group has chosen to apply the
hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.

The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties.
The Group monitors changes in credit risk by
tracking published external credit ratings.
The Group preliminary estimated that application of IFRS 9’s impairment requirements at 1 January
2018 will not result in impairment to be recognised.

(iii) Classiﬁcation - Financial liabilities
IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements
in IAS 39 for the classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial liabilities.

(v) Disclosures
IFRS 9 will require extensive new disclosures,
in particular about hedge accounting, credit risk and
expected credit losses. The Group’s assessment included
an analysis to identify data gaps against current processes
and the Group is in the process of implementing the system and controls changes that it believes will be necessary
to capture the required data.

(vi) Transition

However, under IAS 39 all fair value changes of
liabilities designated as at FVTPL are recognised in proﬁt
or loss, whereas under IFRS 9 these fair value changes are
generally presented as follows:

The Group will take advantage of the exemption
allowing it not to restate comparative information for prior
periods. Diﬀerences in the carrying amounts of ﬁnancial
assets and ﬁnancial liabilities resulting from the adoption
of IFRS 9 will generally be recognised in retained earnings
and reserves as at 1 January 2018.

the amount of change in the fair value that is
attributable to changes in the credit risk of the
liability is presented in OCI; and

The following assessments was made on the
basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the
date of initial application:

the remaining amount of change in the fair
value is presented in proﬁt or loss.

The determination of the business model
within which a financial asset is held (held for
collateral or held for trading);

The Group has not designated any ﬁnancial liabilities at FVTPL and it has no current intention to do so. The
Group’s assessment did not indicate any material impact
regarding the classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial liabilities at 1 January 2018.

232

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance,
including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts
and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.

(i) Sales of goods
For the sale of primary aluminium, alloys, alumina, bauxite and other products revenue is currently
recognised when related risks and rewards of ownership
transfer under delivery terms of the contracts. Revenue
is recognised at this point provided that the revenue and
costs can be measured reliably, the recovery of the consideration is probable and there is no continuing management involvement with the goods.
Under IFRS 15, revenue will be recognised when a
customer will obtain control of the goods. Based on management’s assessment this will not signiﬁcantly impact
the Group’s revenue recognition approach and the timing
of revenue recognition.
As part of sales of goods the Group also perfomrs
transportation to the point of delivery to customer under
contract terms. In certain cases the control for goods
delivered is transferred to customer at earlier point than
the transportation is completed. Currently revenue is recognised both for goods and transportation services at the
point in time when the risks and rewards of goods ownership transfer to customer.
Under IFRS 15, revenue from sale of goods will be
recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods
and revenue for the transportation after the above control
transfer will be recognised over time from goods control
transfer till completion of the transportation. Based on
management’s assessment such revenue deferral will not
signiﬁcantly impact the total amount of revenue recognised by the Group for each reporting period.

Under certain Group sale contracts the ﬁnal
price for the goods shipped is determined a few months
later than the delivery took place. Under current requirements the Group determines the amount of revenue at
the moment of recognition based on estimated selling
price. At price ﬁnalisation the diﬀerence between estimated price and actual one is recognised as revenue from
sale of goods. IFRS 15 application will not result in a signiﬁcant change in the amount of revenue recognised and the
moment of recognition. But IFRS 15 will impact the classiﬁcation of the revenue recognised: revenue initially recognised at the moment of control transfer to the customer
will be recognised as revenue from contract with customers. The amount of price adjustment on ﬁnalisation will be
recognised as other revenue.

(ii) Rendering of services
The Group is involved in sales of energy and provision of transportation services. Revenue from energy
sales is recognised over time during the period when the
energy is transferred to the customer. Based on management’s assessment this will not signiﬁcantly impact the
Group’s revenue recognition approach in terms of the
timing of revenue recognition and amount of revenue recognised for the reporting period. Revenue from transportation services is related to the sales of goods and is considered above.

(iii) Transition
The Group plans to adopt IFRS 15 using the cumulative eﬀect method, with the eﬀect of initially applying
this standard recognised at the date of initial application
(i.e. 1 January 2018). As a result, the Group will not apply
the requirements of IFRS 15 to the comparative period
presented.

233

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

IFRS 16, Leases
IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance
including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether
an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating
Leases—Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance
of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
The standard is eﬀective for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Early adoption is
permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15 at or before the
date of initial application of IFRS 16.
IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet
lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a
right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation
to make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value items.
Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard
– i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as ﬁnance or operating leases.
The Group is currently assessing the impacts of
adopting IFRS 16 on its ﬁnancial statements.

(i) Transition
As a lessee, the Group can either apply the standard using a:
retrospective approach; or
modiﬁed retrospective approach with optional
practical expedients.

The lessee applies the election consistently to all
of its leases.
The Group plans to apply IFRS 16 initially on 1
January 2019, using the modiﬁed retrospective approach.
Therefore, the cumulative eﬀect of adopting IFRS 16 will
be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of
retained earnings at 1 January 2019, with no restatement
of comparative information.
When applying the modiﬁed retrospective
approach to leases previously classiﬁed as operating
leases under IAS 17, the lessee can elect, on a lease-bylease basis, whether to apply a number of practical expedients on transition. The Group is assessing the potential
impact of using these practical expedients.
(b)

Basis of measurement

The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have
been prepared in accordance with the historical cost basis
except as set out in the signiﬁcant accounting policies in
the related notes below.
(c)

Functional and presentation currency

The Company’s functional currency is the United
States Dollar (“USD”) because it reﬂects the economic
substance of the underlying events and circumstances
of the Company. The functional currencies of the Group’s
signiﬁcant subsidiaries are the currencies of the primary economic environment and key business processes
of these subsidiaries and include USD, Russian Rubles
(“RUB”), Ukrainian Hryvna and Euros (“EUR”). The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in USD, rounded
to the nearest million, except as otherwise stated herein.

234

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

(d)

Use of judgements, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
aﬀect the application of accounting policies and reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements, and the reported revenue and costs during
the relevant period.
Management bases its judgements and estimates on historical experience and various other factors
that are believed to be appropriate and reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of
making the judgements about carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may diﬀer from these estimates
under diﬀerent assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision aﬀects only that period, or in
the period of the revision and future periods if the revision
aﬀects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRSs that have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and estimates with a signiﬁcant risk of material adjustment in the next year relate
to:
measurement of recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment (note 13) and goodwill (note 14)
measurement of net realizable value of inventories (note 16);
measurement of recoverable amount of interests in associates and joint ventures (note 15);
estimates in respect of legal proceedings, restoration and exploration, taxation and pension
reserve (note 20).

3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Signiﬁcant accounting policies are described in the related
notes to the ﬁnancial statements captions and in this
note. The following signiﬁcant accounting policies have
been applied in the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The accounting policies and judgements
applied by the Group in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements are the same as those applied by the Group in its
consolidated ﬁnancial statements as at and for the year
ended 31 December 2016 and have been consistently
applied to all periods presented in these consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.
(a)

Basis of consolidation

(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the
entity and has the ability to aﬀect those returns through its
power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group
has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and
other parties) are considered.
An investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements from the date that
control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances, transactions and cash ﬂows and any
unrealised proﬁts arising from intra-group transactions
are eliminated in full in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements. Unrealised losses resulting from intra-group
transactions are eliminated in the same way as unrealised
gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of
impairment.
When the group loses control of a subsidiary, it
is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in that
subsidiary, with a resulting gain or loss being recognised
in proﬁt or loss. Any interest retained in that former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is recognised at fair
value and this amount is regarded as the fair value on initial
recognition of a ﬁnancial asset or, when appropriate, the
cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate
or joint venture.

235

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation

(ii) Foreign operations

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any
unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated
against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the
same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that
there is no evidence of impairment.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations,
including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on
acquisition, are translated from their functional currencies
to USD at the exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to USD at exchange rates approximating exchange
rates at the dates of the transactions.

(b)

Foreign currencies

(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated
into the respective functional currencies of Group entities
at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to
the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is
the diﬀerence between the amortized cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted
for eﬀective interest and payments during the period, and
the amortized cost in foreign currency translated at the
exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Nonmonetary items in a foreign currency are measured based
on historical cost and translated using the exchange rate
at the date of transaction. Foreign currency diﬀerences
arising on retranslation are recognised in the statement of
income, except for diﬀerences arising on the retranslation
of qualifying cash ﬂow hedges to the extent the hedge is
eﬀective, which is recognised in the other comprehensive
income.

Foreign currency diﬀerences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income and presented in the currency translation reserve
in equity. For the purposes of foreign currency translation,
the net investment in a foreign operation includes foreign currency intra-group balances for which settlement
is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future and
foreign currency diﬀerences arising from such a monetary
item are recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, such
that control, signiﬁcant inﬂuence or joint control is lost,
the cumulative amount of the currency translation reserve
is transferred to the statement of income as part of the
gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only
part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign
operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion
of the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of only part of its
investment in an associate or joint venture that includes
a foreign operation while retaining signiﬁcant inﬂuence
or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative
amount is reclassiﬁed to the statement of income.

4 SEGMENT REPORTING
(a)

Reportable segments

An operating segment is a component of the
Group that engages in business activities from which it
may earn revenue and incur expenses, including revenue
and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the
Group’s other components. All operating segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s CEO
to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the
segment and assess its performance and for which discrete consolidated ﬁnancial information or statements are
available.
Individually material operating segments are not
aggregated for ﬁnancial reporting purposes unless the
segments have similar economic characteristics and are
similar in respect of the nature of products and services,
the nature of production processes, the type or class of
customers, the methods used to distribute the products
or provide the services and the nature of the regulatory
environment. Operating segments which are not individually material may be aggregated if they share a majority of
these criteria.
The Group has four reportable segments, as
described below, which are the Group’s strategic business
units. These business units are managed separately and
the results of their operations are reviewed by the CEO on
a regular basis.

Aluminium. The Aluminium segment is involved in
the production and sale of primary aluminium and related
products.
Alumina. The Alumina segment is involved in the
mining and reﬁning of bauxite into alumina and the sale of
alumina.
Energy. The Energy segment includes the Group
companies and projects engaged in the mining and sale
of coal and the generation and transmission of electricity produced from various sources. Where the generating
facility is solely a part of an alumina or aluminium production facility it is included in the respective reportable segment.
Mining and Metals. The Mining and Metals segment includes the equity investment in PJSC MMC Norilsk
Nickel (“Norilsk Nickel”).
Other operations include manufacturing of semiﬁnished products from primary aluminium for the transportation, packaging, building and construction, consumer
goods and technology industries; and the activities of the
Group’s administrative centers. None of these segments
meet any of the quantitative thresholds for determining
reportable segments in 2017 and 2016.
The Aluminium and Alumina segments are vertically integrated whereby the Alumina segment supplies
alumina to the Aluminium segment for further reﬁning and
smelting with limited sales of alumina outside the Group.
Integration between the Aluminium, Alumina and Energy
segments also includes shared servicing and distribution.

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

(b)

Segment results, assets and liabilities

For the purposes of assessing segment performance and allocating resources between segments,
the Group’s senior executive management monitor the
results, assets and liabilities attributable to each reportable segment on the following bases:
Segment assets include all tangible, intangible
assets and current assets with the exception of income tax
assets and corporate assets. Segment liabilities include
trade and other payables attributable to the production
and sales activities of the individual segments. Loans and
borrowings are not allocated to individual segments as
they are centrally managed by the head oﬃce.
Revenue and expenses are allocated to the
reportable segments with reference to sales generated
by those segments and the expenses incurred by those
segments or which otherwise arise from the depreciation
or amortization of assets attributable to those segments
excluding impairment.
The measure used for reporting segment results
is the statement of income before income tax adjusted for
items not speciﬁcally attributed to individual segments,
such as ﬁnance income, costs of loans and borrowings and
other head oﬃce or corporate administration costs. The
segment proﬁt or loss is included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s CEO. Segment proﬁt or loss is used to measure performance as
management believes that such information is the most
relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.

237

In addition to receiving segment information
concerning segment results, management is provided with
segment information concerning revenue (including intersegment revenue), the carrying value of investments and
share of proﬁts/(losses) of associates and joint ventures,
depreciation, amortization, impairment and additions
of non-current segment assets used by the segments in
their operations. Inter-segment pricing is determined on a
consistent basis using market benchmarks.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost
incurred during the year to acquire property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill.
During the year ended 31 December 2017 the
Group has revised its approach to segment allocation for
management review and ﬁnancial reporting purposes. The
comparative information in respect of segment assets
and liabilities as at 31 December 2016 has been revised
accordingly.

(iii) Geographic information
The Group’s operating segments are managed on
a worldwide basis, but operate in four principal geographical areas: the CIS, Europe, Africa and the Americas. In the
CIS, production facilities operate in Russia and Ukraine.
In Europe, production facilities are located in Italy, Ireland
and Sweden. African production facilities are represented
by bauxite mines and an alumina reﬁnery in Guinea and
an aluminium plant in Nigeria. In the Americas the Group
operates one production facility in Jamaica, one in Guyana
and a trading subsidiary in the United States of America.

The following table sets out information about
the geographical location of (i) the Group’s revenue from
external customers and (ii) the Group’s property, plant
and equipment, intangible assets and interests in associates and joint ventures (“speciﬁed non-current assets”).
The geographical location of customers is based on the
location at which the services were provided or the goods
were delivered. The geographical location of the speciﬁed
non-current assets is based on the physical location of the
asset. Unallocated speciﬁed non-current assets comprise
mainly goodwill and interests in associates and joint ventures.

5 REVENUE
Accounting policies
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the
signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership have been
transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration
is probable, the associated costs and possible return of
goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing
management involvement with the good and the amount

of revenue can be measured reliably. This is generally when
title passes. If it is probable that discounts will be granted
and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales
are recognised.
For the majority of sales transactions agreements specify that title passes on the bill of lading date,
which is the date the commodity is delivered to the shipping agent.

(c)

Personnel costs

Accounting policies
Personnel costs comprise salaries, annual
bonuses, annual leave and cost of non-monetary beneﬁts. Salaries, annual bonuses, paid annual leave and
cost of non-monetary beneﬁts are accrued in the year in
which the associated services are rendered by employees.
Where payment or settlement is deferred and the eﬀect
would be material, these amounts are stated at their present values.
The employees of the Group are also members
of retirement schemes operated by local authorities. The
Group is required to contribute a certain percentage of
their payroll to these schemes to fund the beneﬁts. The
Group’s total contribution to those schemes charged to
the statement of income during the years presented is
shown below.

The Group’s net obligation in respect of deﬁned
beneﬁt pension and other post-retirement plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount
of future beneﬁt that employees have earned in return for
their service in the current and prior periods; that beneﬁt
is discounted to determine its present value and the fair
value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate
is the yield at the reporting date on government bonds
that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the
Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed using
the projected unit credit method. When the calculation
results in a beneﬁt to the Group, the recognised asset is
limited to the net total of any unrecognised past service
costs and the present value of any future refunds from the
plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Where there is a change in actuarial assumptions,
the resulting actuarial gains and losses are recognised
directly in other comprehensive income.
When the beneﬁts of a plan are improved, the
portion of the increased beneﬁt relating to past service by
employees is recognised in the statement of income on a
straight-line basis over the average period until the beneﬁts become vested. To the extent that the beneﬁts vest
immediately, the expense is recognised immediately.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the
curtailment or settlement of a deﬁned beneﬁt plan when
the curtailment or settlement occurs.

249

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

The gain or loss on curtailment comprises any
resulting change in the fair value of plan assets, any change
in the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation, any
related actuarial gains and losses.

Accounting policies
Finance income comprises interest income on
funds invested, changes in the fair value of ﬁnancial assets
at fair value through proﬁt or loss and foreign currency
gains. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using
the eﬀective interest method.

Finance expenses comprise interest expense on
borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value of ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss. All borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of income using
the eﬀective interest method, except for borrowing costs
related to the acquisition, construction and production of
qualifying assets which are recognised as part of the cost
of such assets.

8 INCOME TAX
Accounting policies
Income tax expense comprises current and
deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the
statement of income and other comprehensive income
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised
directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the
taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or
substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary diﬀerences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not
recognised for the following temporary diﬀerences: the
initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of
assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
combination and that aﬀects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt, and diﬀerences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they probably will not reverse

in the foreseeable future. New information may become
available that causes the Company to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liability. Such
changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expenses in the
period that such a determination is made. Deferred tax is
measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied
to the temporary diﬀerences when they reverse, based on
the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted
by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are oﬀset when they relate to income taxes levied by the
same taxation authority and the Group has both the right
and the intention to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net or simultaneous basis.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent
that it is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which temporary diﬀerences can be utilized.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date
and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
that the related tax beneﬁt will be realized.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as
the liability to pay the related dividends is recognized.

change from year to year. Applicable income tax rates for
2017 are 9.27% and 14.60% for diﬀerent subsidiaries. For
the Group’s signiﬁcant trading companies, the applicable
tax rate is 0%. The applicable tax rates for the year ended

dividend distributions are subject to taxation included
USD1,387 million and USD1,192 million as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, respectively, for which
deferred taxation has not been provided because remittance of the earnings has been indeﬁnitely postponed
through reinvestment and, as a result, such amounts are

considered to be permanently invested. It was not practicable to determine the amount of temporary diﬀerences
relating to investments in subsidiaries where the Group
is able to control the timing of reversal of the diﬀerence.
Reversal is not expected in the foreseeable future. For
other subsidiaries in the Group, including the signiﬁcant
trading companies, the distribution of dividends does not
give rise to taxes.

13 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Accounting policies

(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment, are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment at
1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRSs, was determined by reference to its fair value at that date.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct
labor, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the
asset to a working condition for its intended use, the costs
of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the
site on which they are located and capitalised borrowing
costs. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that
equipment.

(iii) Exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation activities involve the
search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability
of an identiﬁed resource. Exploration and evaluation activities include:
researching and analysing historical exploration data;
gathering exploration data through topographical, geochemical and geophysical studies;
exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;
determining and examining the volume and
grade of the resource;
surveying transportation and infrastructure
requirements; and
conducting market and ﬁnance studies.

When parts of an item of property, plant and
equipment have diﬀerent useful lives, they are accounted
for as separate items (major components) of property,
plant and equipment.

Administration costs that are not directly attributable to a speciﬁc exploration area are charged to the
statement of income.

The cost of periodic relining of electrolysers is
capitalised and depreciated over the expected production
period.

License costs paid in connection with a right to
explore in an existing exploration area are capitalised and
amortized over the term of the permit.

Gains or losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing
the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of
property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net
within gain/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment in the statement of income.

Exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets when it is
expected that expenditure related to an area of interest will be recouped by future exploitation, sale, or, at
the reporting date, the exploration and evaluation activities have not reached a stage that permits a reasonable
assessment of the existence of commercially recoverable ore reserves. Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is recorded as a component of property,
plant and equipment at cost less impairment losses. As
the asset is not available for use, it is not depreciated.
All capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is
monitored for indications of impairment. Where there are
indicators of potential impairment, an assessment is performed for each area of interest in conjunction with the
group of operating assets (representing a cash-generat-

(ii) Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying
amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic beneﬁts embodied within the part will ﬂow to the
Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying
amount of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs of
the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment
are recognised in the statement of income as incurred.

265

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

ing unit) to which the exploration is attributed. Exploration
areas at which reserves have been discovered but which
require major capital expenditure before production can
begin are continually evaluated to ensure that commercial
quantities of reserves exist or to ensure that additional
exploration work is underway or planned. To the extent
that capitalised expenditure is not expected to be recovered it is charged to the statement of income.
Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to mining property, plant and equipment or intangible assets when development is sanctioned.

(iv) Stripping costs
Expenditure relating to the stripping of overburden layers of ore, including estimated site restoration
costs, is included in the cost of production in the period in
which it is incurred.

(v) Mining assets
Mining assets are recorded as construction in
progress and transferred to mining property, plant and
equipment when a new mine reaches commercial production.

(vi) Depreciation
The carrying amounts of property, plant and
equipment (including initial and any subsequent capital
expenditure) are depreciated to their estimated residual
value over the estimated useful lives of the speciﬁc assets
concerned, or the estimated life of the associated mine
or mineral lease, if shorter. Estimates of residual values
and useful lives are reassessed annually and any change
in estimate is taken into account in the determination of
remaining depreciation charges. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful
lives. Freehold land is not depreciated.
The property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line or units of production basis over the
respective estimated useful lives as follows:
Buildings

30 to 50 years;

Plant, machinery
and equipment

5 to 40 years;

Electrolysers

4 to 15 years;

Mining assets

units of production
on proven and
probable reserves;

Other (except for
exploration and
evaluation assets)

1 to 20 years.

Mining assets include expenditure incurred for:
Acquiring mineral and development rights;
Developing new mining operations.
Mining assets include interest capitalised during
the construction period, when ﬁnanced by borrowings.

Depreciation expense of USD468 million (2016:
USD426 million) has been charged to cost of goods sold,
USD3 million (2016: USD3 million) to distribution expenses
and USD13 million (2016: USD16 million) to administrative
expenses.
During the year ended 31 December 2017 interest expense of USD16 million was capitalised following
commencement of active construction at several projects. During the year ended 2016 no interest expense was
capitalised due to postponement of construction projects
as a result of the economic environment.
Included into construction in progress at 31
December 2017 and 2016 are advances to suppliers of
property, plant and equipment of USD134 million and
USD89 million, respectively.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment subject to lien under loan agreements was USD3 million as at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: USD225
million), refer to note 19.

(g) Impairment
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, each asset or cash generating unit is evaluated every
reporting period to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indication exists, a formal estimate of recoverable amount is performed and an
impairment loss recognised to the extent that the carrying
amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount of an asset or cash generating group of assets is
measured at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal
and value in use.
Fair value is determined as the amount that
would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s
length transaction between knowledgeable and willing
parties and is generally determined as the present value
of the estimated future cash ﬂows expected to arise from
the continued use of the asset, including any expansion
prospects, and its eventual disposal.

Value in use is also generally determined as the
present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows, but only
those expected to arise from the continued use of the
asset in its present form and its eventual disposal. Present
values are determined using a risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the risks inherent in the asset.
Future cash ﬂow estimates are based on expected production and sales volumes, commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related
factors), bauxite reserve estimate, operating costs, restoration and rehabilitation costs and future capital expenditure.
Bauxite reserves are estimates of the amount
of product that can be economically and legally extracted
from the Group’s properties. In order to calculate reserves,
estimates and assumptions are required about a range
of geological, technical and economic factors, including
quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates,
production costs, transport costs, commodity demand,
commodity prices and exchange rates. The Group determines ore reserves under the Australasian Code for
Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves September 1999, known as the JORC Code. The JORC Code
requires the use of reasonable investment assumptions to
calculate reserves.
Management identiﬁed several factors that
indicated that previously recognised impairment loss in
respect of a number of the Group’s cash-generating units
may require reversal. These include signiﬁcant increase
of aluminium and alumina prices during the year as result
of continued LME recovery. In aluminium production, the
Group faced increase in cash cost due to increase in alumina costs partially counterbalanced by application of
cash cost control measures. For alumina cash generating
units, major inﬂuence was on the part of recovery in alumina prices and increase in prices of energy resources
being a signiﬁcant part of cash cost. Bauxite cash generating units incurred more or less stable sale price of bauxite.
For the purposes of impairment testing the
recoverable amount of each cash generating unit was
determined by discounting expected future net cash ﬂows
of the cash generating unit.

269

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

Based on results of impairment testing as at
31 December 2017, management has concluded that a
reversal of previously recognised impairment loss relating
to property, plant and equipment should be recognised in
these consolidated ﬁnancial statements in respect of the
Windalco cash generating unit in the amount of USD63
million.
Based on results of impairment testing as at
31 December 2016, management has concluded that an
impairment loss relating to property, plant and equipment should be recognised in these ﬁnancial statements
in respect of the Bauxite Company of Guyana Inc., Armenal and Ural Foil cash generating units in the amounts of
USD58 million, USD48 million and USD13 million, respectively, as the determined recoverable amount was nega-

tive. Management has also concluded that a reversal of
previously recognised impairment loss relating to property, plant and equipment should be recognised in these
ﬁnancial statements in respect of the Kubikenborg Aluminium, Kremniy, Windalco, Aughinish Alumina, Kandalaksha smelter and Irkutsk smelter cash generating units
in the amounts of USD124 million, USD52 million, USD48
million, USD38 million, USD30 million and USD7 million,
respectively.
For the purposes of impairment testing the
recoverable amount of each cash generating unit was
determined by discounting expected future net cash ﬂows
of the cash generating unit. The pre-tax discount rates
applied to the above mentioned cash generating units,
estimated in nominal terms based on an industry weighted
average cost of capital, are presented in the table below.

The recoverable amount of a number of the cash
generating units tested for impairment are particularly
sensitive to changes in forecast aluminium and alumina
prices, foreign exchange rates and applicable discount
rates.
Additionally, management identiﬁed speciﬁc
items of property, plant and equipment that are no longer
in use and therefore are not considered to be recoverable
amounting to USD83 million at 31 December 2017 (2016:
USD67 million). These assets have been impaired in full.
No further impairment of property, plant and equipment
or reversal of previously recorded impairment was identiﬁed by management.

(h) Leased assets
Leases under the terms of which the Group
assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases. Upon initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to

the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition,
the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
The corresponding ﬁnance lease obligation is
included within interest bearing liabilities. The interest element is allocated to accounting periods during the lease
term to reﬂect a constant rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Assets held under other leases (operating leases)
are not recognised in the statement of ﬁnancial position.
Payments made under the lease are charged to the statement of income in equal instalments over the accounting
periods covered by the lease term, except where an alternative basis is more representative of the pattern of beneﬁts to be derived from the leased assets. Lease incentives received are recognised in the statement of income
as an integral part of the aggregate net lease payments
made. Contingent rentals are charged to the statement of
income in the accounting period in which they are incurred.

14 INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Accounting policies

(i) Goodwill
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, an interest
in a joint venture or an associate or an interest in a joint
arrangement that comprises a business, the identiﬁable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired
business (or interest in a business) are recognised at their
fair values unless the fair values cannot be measured reliably. Where the fair values of assumed contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably, no liability is recognised
but the contingent liability is disclosed in the same manner
as for other contingent liabilities.
Goodwill arises when the cost of acquisition
exceeds the fair value of the Group’s interest in the net
fair value of identiﬁable net assets acquired. Goodwill is
not amortized but is tested for impairment annually. For
this purpose, goodwill arising on a business combination
is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to beneﬁt from the acquisition and any impairment loss recognised is not reversed even where circumstances indicate a
recovery in value.
When the fair value of the Group’s share of identiﬁable net assets acquired exceeds the cost of acquisition,
the diﬀerence is recognised immediately in the statement
of income.
In respect of associates or joint ventures, the
carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying
amount of the interest in the associate and joint venture
and the investment as a whole is tested for impairment
whenever there is objective evidence of impairment. Any
impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the
interest in the associate and joint venture.

(ii) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken
with the prospect of gaining new scientiﬁc or technical
knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the statement of income when incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design
for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably,
the product or process is technically and commercially
feasible, future economic beneﬁts are probable and the
Group intends to and has suﬃcient resources to complete
development and to use or sell the asset. The expenditure
capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labor and
overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing
the asset for its intended use and capitalised borrowing
costs. Other development expenditure is recognised in
the statement of income when incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

(iii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the
Group, which have ﬁnite useful lives, are measured at cost
less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when
it increases the future economic beneﬁts embodied in the
speciﬁc asset to which it relates. All other expenditure,
including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and
brands, is recognised in the statement of income when
incurred.

(v) Amortization
Amortization is recognized in the statement of
income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the
date that they are available for use. The estimated useful
lives are as follows:
software

5 years;

other

2-8 years.

The amortization method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each ﬁnancial year end and
adjusted if appropriate.

Goodwill recognised in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements initially arose on the formation of the

Group in 2000 and the acquisition of a 25% additional
interest in the Group by its controlling shareholder in
2003. The amount of goodwill was principally increased in
2007 as a result of the acquisition of certain businesses of
SUAL Partners and Glencore.

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

(i) Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible
assets
For the purposes of impairment testing, the
entire amount of goodwill is allocated to the aluminium
segment of the Group’s operations. The aluminium segment represents the lowest level within the Group at
which the goodwill is monitored for internal management
purposes. The recoverable amount represents value in
use as determined by discounting the future cash ﬂows
generated from the continuing use of the plants within the
Group’s aluminium segment.
Similar considerations to those described above
in respect of assessing the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment apply to goodwill.
At 31 December 2017, management analysed
changes in the economic environment and developments
in the aluminium industry and the Group’s operations
since 31 December 2016 and performed an impairment
test for goodwill at 31 December 2017 using the following
assumptions to determine the recoverable amount of the
segment:
Total production was estimated based on average sustainable production levels of 3.8 million
metric tonnes of primary aluminium, of 8.0
million metric tonnes of alumina and of 12.3
million metric tonnes of bauxite. Bauxite and
alumina will be used primarily internally for
production of primary aluminium;
Sales prices were based on the long-term aluminium price outlook derived from available
industry and market sources at USD2,058 per
tonne for primary aluminium in 2018, USD2,043
in 2019, USD2,035 in 2020, USD2,037 in 2021,
USD2,053 in 2022. Operating costs were projected based on the historical performance
adjusted for inﬂation;
Nominal foreign currency exchange rates
applied to convert operating costs of the Group
denominated in RUB into USD were RUB62.3 for
one USD in 2018, RUB61.4 in 2019, RUB62.2 in
2020, RUB60.5 in 2021, RUB59.5 in 2022. Inﬂation of 3.9% – 4.9% in RUB and 1.3% - 2.3% in
USD was assumed in determining recoverable
amounts;

The pre-tax discount rate was estimated in
nominal terms based on the weighted average
cost of capital basis and was 13.1%;
A terminal value was derived following the
forecast period assuming a 1.7% annual growth
rate.
Values assigned to key assumptions and estimates used to measure the units’ recoverable amount
was based on external sources of information and historic
data. Management believes that the values assigned to
the key assumptions and estimates represented the most
realistic assessment of future trends. The results were
particularly sensitive to the following key assumptions:
A 5% reduction in the projected aluminium
price level would have resulted in a decrease in
the recoverable amount by 26% but would not
lead to an impairment;
A 5% increase in the projected level of electricity and alumina costs in the aluminium production would have resulted in a 17% decrease in
the recoverable amount but would not lead to
an impairment;
A 1% increase in the discount rate would have
resulted in a 7% decrease in the recoverable
amount but would not lead to an impairment.
Based on results of impairment testing of goodwill, management concluded that no impairment should be
recorded in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as at 31
December 2017.
At 31 December 2016, management analysed
changes in the economic environment and developments
in the aluminium industry and the Group’s operations
since 31 December 2015 and performed an impairment
test for goodwill at 31 December 2016 using the following
assumptions to determine the recoverable amount of the
segment:
Total production was estimated based on average sustainable production levels of 3.7 million
metric tonnes of primary aluminium, of 7.8
million metric tonnes of alumina and of 12.0
million metric tonnes of bauxite. Bauxite and
alumina will be used primarily internally for
production of primary aluminium;

275

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

Sales prices were based on the long-term aluminium price outlook derived from available
industry and market sources at USD1,673 per
tonne for primary aluminium in 2017, USD1,703
in 2018, USD1,726 in 2019, USD1,789 in 2020,
USD1,911 in 2021. Operating costs were projected based on the historical performance
adjusted for inﬂation;
Nominal foreign currency exchange rates
applied to convert operating costs of the Group
denominated in RUB into USD were RUB62.4 for
one USD in 2017, RUB67.7 in 2018, RUB69.7 in
2019, RUB71.0 in 2020, RUB69.0 in 2021. Inﬂation of 4.4% – 5.4% in RUB and 1.3% - 2.2% in
USD was assumed in determining recoverable
amounts;
The pre-tax discount rate was estimated in
nominal terms based on the weighted average
cost of capital basis and was 13.7%;
A terminal value was derived following the
forecast period assuming a 1.8% annual growth
rate.
Values assigned to key assumptions and estimates used to measure the units’ recoverable amount
was based on external sources of information and historic
data. Management believes that the values assigned to
the key assumptions and estimates represented the most
realistic assessment of future trends. The results were
particularly sensitive to the following key assumptions:
A 5% reduction in the projected aluminium
price level would have resulted in a decrease in
the recoverable amount by 23% but would not
lead to an impairment;
A 5% increase in the projected level of electricity and alumina costs in the aluminium production would have resulted in a 15% decrease in
the recoverable amount but would not lead to
an impairment;
A 1% increase in the discount rate would have
resulted in a 8% decrease in the recoverable
amount but would not lead to an impairment.
Based on results of impairment testing of goodwill, management concluded that no impairment should be
recorded in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as at 31
December 2016.

15 INTERESTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT
VENTURES
Accounting policies
An associate is an entity in which the Group or
Company has signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control or joint
control, over its management, including participation in
the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions.
A joint venture is an arrangement whereby the
Group or Company and other parties contractually agree
to share control of the arrangement, and have rights to the
net assets of the arrangement.
An investment in an associate or a joint venture
is accounted for in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
under the equity method, unless it is classiﬁed as held
for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classiﬁed
as held for sale). Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost, adjusted for any excess
of the Group’s share of the acquisition-date fair values of
the investee’s identiﬁable net assets over the cost of the
investment (if any). Thereafter, the investment is adjusted
for the post acquisition change in the Group’s share of the
investee’s net assets and any impairment loss relating to
the investment. Any acquisition-date excess over cost,
the Group’s share of the post-acquisition, post-tax results
of the investees and any impairment losses for the year
are recognised in the consolidated statement of income,
whereas the Group’s share of the post-acquisition posttax items of the investees’ other comprehensive income is
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its
interest in the associate or the joint venture, the Group’s
interest is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses
is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.
Unrealised proﬁts and losses resulting from
transactions between the Group and its associates and
joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the group’s
interest in the investee, except where unrealised losses
provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case they are recognised immediately in
proﬁt or loss.

276

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, each investment in an associate or joint venture is
evaluated every reporting period to determine whether
there are any indications of impairment after application of the equity method of accounting. If any such indication exists, a formal estimate of recoverable amount
is performed and an impairment loss recognised to the
extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount of an investment in an
associate or joint venture is measured at the higher of fair

value less costs of disposal and value in use.
Similar considerations to those described above
in respect of assessing the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment apply to investments in associates or joint venture. In addition to the considerations
described above the Group may also assess the estimated
future cash ﬂows expected to arise from dividends to be
received from the investment, if such information is available and considered reliable.

(a) PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel
The Group’s investment in Norilsk Nickel is
accounted for using equity method and the carrying value
as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 amounted
USD3,796 million and USD3,592 million, respectively. The
market value amounted USD8,294 million and USD7,348
million as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016,
respectively, and is determined by multiplying the quoted
bid price per share on the Moscow Exchange on the yearend date by the number of shares held by the Group.
The Group has previously issued consolidated
ﬁnancial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2017 dated 22 February 2018. At that date the Group
was unable to obtain consolidated ﬁnancial statements of
PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel, as at and for the year ended 31
December 2017. Consequently management estimated
the Group’s share of proﬁt, other comprehensive income
and foreign currency translation gain in relation to Norilsk
Nickel for the year ended 31 December 2017 based on the
latest publicly available information reported by Norilsk
Nickel for six months ended 30 June 2017 adjusted by the
Group to account for Norilsk Nickel’s performance in the
second half of 2017. On 6 March 2018 PJSC MMC Norilsk
Nickel published its audited consolidated ﬁnancial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as at and for the
year ended 31 December 2017. Management has used
this information to reassess the Group’s share in the profits and other comprehensive income of the investee and
compare these amounts to their previous estimates. As
a result of this comparison, management has concluded

that the Group’s share of proﬁt, foreign currency translation gain and other comprehensive income for the year
ended 31 December 2017 as well as the carrying amount
of the Group’s interest in associates as at 31 December
2017 reported in the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements issued on 22 February 2018 do not require restatement.
(b) Queensland Alumina Limited (“QAL”)
The carrying value of the Group’s investment
in Queensland Alumina Limited as at both 31 December
2017 and 31 December 2016 amounted to USD nil million. At 31 December 2017 management has not identiﬁed
any impairment reversal indicators relating to the Group’s
investment in QAL and as a result no detailed impairment
testing was performed in relation to this investment.
(c) BEMO project
The carrying value of the Group’s investment in
BEMO project as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 amounted USD523 million and USD436 million,
respectively.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the
BEMO project was separated into two cash generating
units – the Boguchansky Aluminium Smelter (“BoAZ’)
and the Boguchansky Hydro Power Plant (“BoGES”). The
recoverable amount was determined by discounting the
expected future net cash ﬂows of each cash generating
unit.

280

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

At 31 December 2017 management has not identiﬁed any impairment indicators relating to the Group’s
investment in BoGES and as a result no detailed impairment testing was performed in relation to this investment. Results of impairment testing of BoAZ investment
for the year ended 31 December 2017 showed that investment in BoAZ is fully impaired and no reversal of previously
recorded impairment was identiﬁed by management.
At 31 December 2017, accumulated losses of
USD573 million (2016: USD550 million) related to impairment charges at BoAZ have not been recognised because
the Group’s investment has already been fully written
down to USD nil million.
At 31 December 2016 management has not identiﬁed any impairment indicators relating to the Group’s

investment in BoGES and as a result no detailed impairment testing was performed in relation to this investment. Results of impairment testing of BoAZ investment
for the year ended 31 December 2016 showed that investment in BoAZ is fully impaired and no reversal of previously
recorded impairment was identiﬁed by management.
The recoverable amounts of the two cash generating units are particularly sensitive to changes in forecast
aluminium and electricity prices, foreign exchange rates,
applicable discount rates and, in respect to BoAZ, the
forecast period to reach full production capacity.
Summary of the additional ﬁnancial information
of the Group's eﬀective interest in BEMO project for the
year ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 is

16 INVENTORIES

The production costs include mining and concentrating costs, smelting, treatment and reﬁning costs,
other cash costs and depreciation and amortization of
operating assets.

Accounting policies
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or
net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the
estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is determined under the
weighted average cost method, and includes expenditure
incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to
their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an
appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.

The Group recognises write-downs of inventories based on an assessment of the net realisable value of
the inventories. A write-down is applied to the inventories
where events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the net realisable value is less than cost. The determination of net realisable value requires the use of judgement
and estimates. Where the expectation is diﬀerent from
the original estimates, such diﬀerence will impact the carrying value of the inventories and the write-down of inventories charged to the statement of income in the periods
in which such estimate has been changed.

17 NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS
Accounting policies
Non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments comprise
investments in securities, trade and other receivables
(excluding prepayments and tax assets), cash and cash
equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other
payables (excluding advances received and tax liabilities).
Non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable
transaction costs.
A ﬁnancial instrument is recognised when the
Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions
of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognised if
the Group’s contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from
the ﬁnancial assets expire or if the Group transfers the
ﬁnancial asset to another party without retaining control
or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Group’s obligations
speciﬁed in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.
Financial assets and liabilities are oﬀset and the
net amount presented in the statement of ﬁnancial position when, and only when, the Group has a legal right to
oﬀset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net
basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities at initial recognition of three months or less that are subject to insigniﬁcant risk of changes in their fair values, and are used by
the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.

Subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative
ﬁnancial instruments are measured as follows:
Trade and other receivables and other nonderivative financial assets are measured at
amortized cost using the effective interest
method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables and other non-derivative financial liabilities subsequent to initial
recognition, are measured at amortized cost
using the eﬀective interest method.
A ﬁnancial asset not carried at fair value through
proﬁt or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is
impaired. A ﬁnancial asset is considered to be impaired if
objective evidence indicates that one or more events have
had a negative eﬀect on the estimated future cash ﬂows
of that asset occurred after the initial recognition of that
asset and the impact can be estimated reliably.
Objective evidence that ﬁnancial assets (including equity securities) are impaired can include default or
delinquency by a debtor, restructuring of an amount due
to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider
otherwise, indications that a debtor or issuer will enter
bankruptcy and the disappearance of an active market for
a security. In addition, for an investment in an equity security, a signiﬁcant or prolonged decline in its fair value below
its cost is objective evidence of impairment.
An impairment loss in respect of a ﬁnancial asset
measured at amortized cost is calculated as the diﬀerence
between its carrying amount and the present value of the
estimated future cash ﬂows discounted at the original
eﬀective interest rate.

283

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

Individually signiﬁcant ﬁnancial assets are tested
for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining ﬁnancial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share
similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in the
statement of income.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the
impairment loss was recognized. For ﬁnancial assets measured at amortized cost, the reversal is recognised in the
statement of income.

Impairment losses for trade receivables included
within trade and other receivables whose recovery is
considered doubtful but not remote are recorded using
an allowance account. When the Group is satisﬁed that
recovery is remote, the amount considered irrecoverable is written oﬀ against trade receivables directly and
any amounts held in the allowance account relating to
that receivable are reversed. Subsequent recoveries of
amounts previously charged to the allowance account are
reversed against the allowance account. Other changes
in the allowance account and subsequent recoveries of
amounts previously written oﬀ directly are recognised in
the statement of income.

dated 18 August 2014 and amended 26 April 2016 in the
total amount of USD524 million, utilizing USD415 million of available commitments under the new reﬁnancing
tranches as well as USD109 million of the Company’s own
funds.
In September 2016 the Group entered into a new
credit facility of USD200 million with JSC Credit Bank of
Moscow with a maturity 3 years and an interest rate of 3M
Libor + 4.15% p.a.
In October 2016 the Group entered into new
credit facilities with Gazprombank for the total amount of
USD178 million with maturity 4 years and interest rate 3M
Libor + 4.5%.
During 2016 the Group made a principal repayment in total amounts of USD1,139 million and EUR84
million (USD93 million) under the Combined PXF Facility,
credit facilities with Gazprombank, VTB Capital and Credit
Bank of Moscow.
On 23 January 2017 the Group made a principal prepayment in total amounts of USD292 million and
EUR17 million (USD18 million) under the Combined PXF
Facility of amounts due in 2017.

In February 2017 the Group registered Panda
Bond Oﬀering Circular for the total amount of RMB10 billion (c.USD1.5 billion) with the Shanghai Stock Exchange
with the right to make placement in tranches with diﬀerent maturities but not higher than 7 years. In March 2017
the ﬁrst tranche of RMB1 billion was placed for 3 years and
5.5% per annum. In September 2017 the second tranche
of RMB500 million was placed for 3 years and 5.5% per
annum. The tranches are subject to put option after 2
years. The funds were used for working capital needs and
reﬁnancing of existing debt.
On 3 April 2017 RUSAL Bratsk announced a coupon rate in respect to the series 08 bonds at the level of
9% per annum for the 13-16 semi-annual coupon periods after which the series 08 bonds will be subject to a
put option and coupon rate revision. On 12 April 2017 the
Group exercised an option to repurchase the outstanding
RUB-denominated bonds series 08.
In May 2017 the Group completed the oﬀering of
Eurobonds with the following key terms: principal amount
of USD500 million, tenor of 6 years, coupon rate of 5.3%
per annum. The bonds proceeds were applied for partial
prepayment of RUSAL’s debt. The closing market price at
31 December 2017 was USD1,013 per bond.

Accounting policies
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past
event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that

an outﬂow of economic beneﬁts will be required to settle
the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ﬂows at a pre-tax rate that
reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of
money and the risks speciﬁc to the liability. The unwinding
of the discount is recognised as ﬁnance costs.

Group subsidiaries outside the Russian Federation and
Ukraine

Group subsidiaries in the Russian Federation
The Group voluntarily provides long-term and postemployment beneﬁts to its former and existing employees
including death-in-service, jubilee, lump sum upon retirement, material support for pensioners and death-in-pension beneﬁts. Furthermore, the Group provides regular
social support payments to some of its veterans of World
War II.
The above employee beneﬁt programs are of a
deﬁned beneﬁt nature. The Group ﬁnances these programs on a pay-as-you-go basis, so plan assets are equal
to zero.
Group subsidiaries in Ukraine
Due to legal requirements, the Ukrainian subsidiaries are
responsible for partial ﬁnancing of the state hardship pensions for those of its employees who worked, or still work,
under severe and hazardous labor conditions (hardship
early retirement pensions). These pensions are paid until
the recipient reaches the age of entitlement to the State
old age pension (55-60 years for female (dependent on
year of birth) and 60 years for male employees). In Ukraine,
the Group also voluntarily provides long-term and postemployment beneﬁts to its employees including death-inservice, lump sum beneﬁts upon retirement and death-inpension beneﬁts.
The above employee beneﬁt programs are of a
deﬁned beneﬁt nature. The Group ﬁnances these programs on a pay-as-you-go basis, so plan assets are equal
to zero.

At its Guinean and Nigerian entities the Group provides a
death-in-service beneﬁt and lump-sum beneﬁts upon disability and old-age retirement.
At its Guyana subsidiary, the Group provides a
death-in-service beneﬁt.
At its Italian subsidiary (Eurallumina) the Group
only provides lump sum beneﬁts upon retirement, which
relate to service up to 1 January 2007.
In Sweden (Kubikenborg Aluminium AB), the
Group provides deﬁned beneﬁt lifelong and temporary
pension beneﬁts. The lifelong beneﬁts are dependent on
the past service and average salary level of the employee,
with an accrual rate that depends on the salary bracket the
employee is in. The liability relates only to beneﬁts accrued
before 1 January 2004.
The number of employees in all jurisdictions eligible for the plans as at 31 December 2017 and 2016 was
57,423 and 56,611, respectively. The number of pensioners in all jurisdictions as at 31 December 2017 and 2016
was 45,044 and 45,915, respectively.
The Group expects to pay under the deﬁned beneﬁt retirement plans an amount of USD5 million during the
12 month period beginning on 1 January 2018.
Actuarial valuation of pension liabilities
The actuarial valuation of the Group and the portion of
the Group funds speciﬁcally designated for the Group’s

(b)

Site restoration

The mining, reﬁning and smelting activities of
the Group can give rise to obligations for site restoration
and rehabilitation. Restoration and rehabilitation works
can include facility decommissioning and dismantling,
removal or treatment of waste materials, land rehabilitation, and site restoration. The extent of work required and
the associated costs are dependent on the requirements
of law and the interpretations of the relevant authorities.
The Group provides for site restoration obligations when there is a speciﬁc legal or constructive obligation for mine reclamation, landﬁll closure (primarily
comprising red mud basin disposal sites) or speciﬁc lease
restoration requirements. The Group does not record any
obligations with respect to decommissioning of its reﬁning or smelting facilities and restoration and rehabilitation
of the surrounding areas unless there is a speciﬁc plan to
discontinue operations at a facility. This is because any
signiﬁcant costs in connection with decommissioning of
reﬁning or smelting facilities and restoration and rehabilitation of the surrounding areas would be incurred no
earlier than when the facility is closed and the facilities
are currently expected to operate over a term in excess of
50-100 years due to the perpetual nature of the reﬁneries
and smelters and continuous maintenance and upgrade
programs resulting in the fair values of any such liabilities
being negligible.
Costs included in the provision encompass obligated and reasonably estimable restoration and rehabilitation activities expected to occur progressively over the
life of the operation and at the time of closure in connection with disturbances at the reporting date. Routine operating costs that may impact the ultimate restoration and
rehabilitation activities, such as waste material handling
conducted as an integral part of a mining or production
process, are not included in the provision. Costs arising
from unforeseen circumstances, such as the contamination caused by unplanned discharges, are recognised as an
expense and liability when the event gives rise to an obligation which is probable and capable of reliable estimation.

303

Restoration and rehabilitation provisions are
measured at the expected value of future cash ﬂows, discounted to their present value and determined according
to the probability of alternative estimates of cash ﬂows
occurring for each operation. Discount rates used are speciﬁc to the country in which the operation is located. Signiﬁcant judgements and estimates are involved in forming
expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the associated cash ﬂows. Those expectations are
formed based on existing environmental and regulatory
requirements.
When provisions for restoration and rehabilitation are initially recognised, the corresponding cost
is capitalised as an asset, representing part of the cost
of acquiring the future economic beneﬁts of the operation. The capitalised cost of restoration and rehabilitation
activities is amortized over the estimated economic life
of the operation on a units of production or straight-line
basis. The value of the provision is progressively increased
over time as the eﬀect of discounting unwinds, creating an
expense recognised as part of ﬁnance expenses.
Restoration and rehabilitation provisions are also
adjusted for changes in estimates. Those adjustments are
accounted for as a change in the corresponding capitalised
cost, except where a reduction in the provision is greater
than the unamortized capitalised cost, in which case the
capitalised cost is reduced to nil and the remaining adjustment is recognised in the statement of income. Changes
to the capitalised cost result in an adjustment to future
amortization charges. Adjustments to the estimated
amount and timing of future restoration and rehabilitation
cash ﬂows are a normal occurrence in light of the signiﬁcant judgements and estimates involved. Factors inﬂuencing those changes include revisions to estimated reserves,
resources and lives of operations; developments in technology; regulatory requirements and environmental management strategies; changes in the estimated costs of
anticipated activities, including the eﬀects of inﬂation and
movements in foreign exchange rates; and movements in
general interest rates aﬀecting the discount rate applied.

(d)

At each reporting date the Directors have
assessed the provisions for site restoration and environmental matters and concluded that the provisions and disclosures are adequate.
(c)

Provisions for legal claims

In the normal course of business the Group may
be involved in legal proceedings. Where management
considers that it is more likely than not that proceedings
will result in the Group compensating third parties a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the amount
expected to be paid. Where management considers that
it is more likely than not that proceedings will not result
in the Group compensating third parties or where, in rare
circumstances, it is not considered possible to provide
a suﬃciently reliable estimate of the amount expected
to be paid, no provision is made for any potential liability
under the litigation but the circumstances and uncertainties involved are disclosed as contingent liabilities. The
assessment of the likely outcome of legal proceedings and
the amount of any potential liability involves signiﬁcant
judgement. As law and regulations in many of the countries in which the Group operates are continuing to evolve,
particularly in the areas of taxation, sub-soil rights and
protection of the environment, uncertainties regarding
litigation and regulation are greater than those typically
found in countries with more developed legal and regulatory frameworks.
The Group’s subsidiaries are subject to a variety
of lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of its business. As at 31 December 2017, there were several claims
ﬁled against the Group’s subsidiaries contesting breaches
of contract terms and non-payment of existing obligations. Management has reviewed the circumstances and
estimated that the amount of probable outﬂow related to
these claims should not exceed USD3 million (31 December 2016: USD nil million). The amount of claims, where
management assesses outﬂow as possible approximates
USD36 million (31 December 2016: USD60 million).

Tax provisions

The Group’s accounting policy for taxation
requires management’s judgement in assessing whether
deferred tax assets and certain deferred tax liabilities are
recognised in the statement of ﬁnancial position. Deferred
tax assets, including those arising from carried forward tax
losses, capital losses and temporary diﬀerences, are recognised only where it is considered more likely than not
that they will be recovered, which is dependent on the
generation of suﬃcient future taxable proﬁts. Deferred
tax liabilities arising from temporary diﬀerences in investments, caused principally by retained earnings held in foreign tax jurisdictions, are recognised unless repatriation
of retained earnings can be controlled and is not expected
to occur in the foreseeable future.
Assumptions about the generation of future taxable proﬁts and repatriation of retained earnings depend
on management’s estimates of future cash ﬂows. These
depend on estimates of future production and sales volumes, commodity prices, reserves, operating costs, restoration and rehabilitation costs, capital expenditure,
dividends and other capital management transactions.
Assumptions are also required about the application of
income tax legislation. These estimates and assumptions
are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of deferred tax assets
and deferred tax liabilities recognised on the statement of
ﬁnancial position and the amount of other tax losses and
temporary diﬀerences not yet recognised. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying amount of recognised
deferred tax assets and liabilities may require adjustment,
resulting in a corresponding credit or charge to the statement of income.

306

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

The Group generally provides for current tax
based on positions taken (or expected to be taken) in its
tax returns. Where it is more likely than not that upon
examination by the tax authorities of the positions taken
by the Group additional tax will be payable, the Group provides for its best estimate of the amount expected to be
paid (including any interest and/or penalties) as part of the
tax charge.
At each reporting date the Directors have
assessed the provisions for taxation and concluded that
the provisions and disclosures are adequate.
(e)

Provision for guarantees

Where the Group enters into ﬁnancial guarantee
contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies, controlled by the beneﬁcial shareholder of the Group,
the Group considers these to be insurance arrangements
and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Group
treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until
such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be
required to make a payment under the guarantee.
In September 2013 the Group entered into an
agreement with OJSC RusHydro to provide funds to BoAZ,
if the latter is unable to fulﬁl its obligations under its credit
facility with GK Vnesheconombank (“VEB”). This agreement represents a surety for the increased credit limit
obtained for the ﬁnancing of BoAZ. The aggregate exposure under the agreement is limited to RUB16.8 billion (31
December 2017 and 2016 USD292 and USD277 million,
respectively) and is split between the Group and OJSC
RusHydro in equal proportion.
During 2016 USD100 million of provision previously recognised was reversed due to fact that maturity
of the initial loan agreement between BoAZ and VEB was
extended from 2027 to 2030 accordingly shifting the date
principal repayments commence and the fact that BoGES
will continue to support BoAZ in settling its liabilities under
the credit facility including principal and interest repayments.

21 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS/
LIABILITIES
Accounting policies
The Group enters, from time to time, into various
derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage its exposure to
commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest
rate risk.
Embedded derivatives are separated from the
host contract and accounted for separately if the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and
the embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded
derivative would meet the deﬁnition of a derivative and
the combined instrument is not measured at fair value
through proﬁt or loss.
On initial designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged
item, including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction and the hedged
risk, together with the methods that will be used to assess
the eﬀectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group
makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge
relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, of whether the
hedging instruments are expected to be highly eﬀective in
oﬀsetting the changes in the fair value or cash ﬂows of the
respective hedged items attributable to the hedged risk,
and whether the actual results of each hedge are within a
range of 80% - 125%. For a cash ﬂow hedge of a forecast
transaction, the transaction should be highly probable to
occur and should present an exposure to variation in cash
ﬂows that ultimately could aﬀect reported proﬁt or loss.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value;
attributable transaction costs are recognised in the statement of income when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value.

307

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

The measurement of fair value of derivative
ﬁnancial instruments, including embedded derivatives, is
based on quoted market prices. Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative
market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions,
fair value is estimated based on the Group’s views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such
estimates. Changes in the fair value therein are accounted
for as described below.
When a derivative is designated as the hedging
instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash ﬂows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised
asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction
that could aﬀect proﬁt or loss, the eﬀective portion of
changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in
the statement of comprehensive income and presented
in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineﬀective portion of
changes in the fair value of a derivative is recognised in the
statement of income.

When the hedged item is a non-ﬁnancial asset,
the amount accumulated in equity is included in the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is recognised. In
other cases, the amount accumulated in equity is reclassiﬁed to the statement of income in the same period
that the hedged item aﬀects proﬁt or loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised,
or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is
discontinued prospectively. If the forecast transaction is
no longer expected to occur, then the balance in equity is
reclassiﬁed to the statement of income.
Changes in the fair value of separated embedded
derivatives and derivative ﬁnancial instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in
the statement of income.

Petroleum coke supply contracts and other raw materials
In May and September 2011, the Group entered into longterm petroleum coke supply contracts where the price of
coke is determined with reference to the LME aluminium
price and the Brent oil price. The strike price for aluminium is set at USD2,403.45 per tonne and USD1,735.03 per

tonne, respectively, while the strike price for oil is set at
USD61.10 per barrel and USD47.7 per barrel, respectively.
In May 2014, the Group entered into long-term
petroleum coke supply contract where the price of coke is
determined with reference to the LME aluminium price and
average monthly aluminium quotations, namely of Aluminum MW US Transaction premium, MB Aluminium Premium
Rotterdam Low - High» and Aluminum CIF Japan premium.
The strike price for aluminium is set at USD1,809.65 per
tonne while the strike aluminium premium quotations for
US, Europe and Japan are set at USD403.96 per tonne,
USD313.30 per tonne and USD366.00 per tonne, respectively.
In November 2015, the Group entered into long-term

22 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND FAIR
VALUES
(a)

Fair values

Management believes that the fair values of
short-term ﬁnancial assets and liabilities approximate
their carrying amounts.
The methods used to estimate the fair values of
the ﬁnancial instruments are as follows:
Trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, current loans and borrowings and trade and other
payables: the carrying amounts approximate fair value
because of the short maturity period of the instruments.
Long-term loans and borrowings, other non-current liabilities: the fair values of other non-current liabilities are based on the present value of the anticipated cash
ﬂows and approximate carrying value, other than Eurobonds and RUSAL Bratsk bonds issued.
Derivatives: the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial
instruments, including embedded derivatives, is based
on quoted market prices. Where no price information is
available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair
value is estimated based on the Group’s views on relevant
future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such
estimates. Option-based derivatives are valued using
Black-Scholes models and Monte-Carlo simulations. The
derivative ﬁnancial instruments are recorded at their fair
value at each reporting date.

309

The following table presents the fair value of
Group’s ﬁnancial instruments measured at the end of the
reporting period on a recurring basis, categorised into
the three-level fair value hierarchy as deﬁned by IFRS 13,
Fair value measurement. The level into which a fair value
measurement is classiﬁed is determined with reference to
the observability and signiﬁcance of the inputs used in the
valuation technique as follows:
Level 1 valuations: Fair value measured using
only Level 1 inputs i.e. unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities at the measurement date
Level 2 valuations: Fair value measured using
Level 2 inputs i.e. observable inputs which
fail to meet Level 1, and not using significant
unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs are
inputs for which market data are not available
Level 3 valuations: Fair value measured using
signiﬁcant unobservable inputs.

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

(b)

Financial risk management objectives and

policies
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial instruments
comprise bank loans and trade payables. The main purpose of these ﬁnancial instruments is to raise ﬁnance for
the Group’s operations. The Group has various ﬁnancial
assets such as trade receivables and cash and short-term
deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial
instruments are cash ﬂow interest rate risk, liquidity risk,
foreign currency risk and credit risk. Management reviews
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which
are summarised below.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk
management framework. The Board has established a risk
management group within its Department of Internal Control, which is responsible for developing and monitoring
the Group’s risk management policies. The Department
reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group,
to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor
risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies
and systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂect changes in
market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group,
through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive
control environment in which all employees understand
their roles and obligations.

The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how
management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk
management policies and procedures and reviews the
adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to
the risks faced by the Group. The Group’s Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by the Group’s Internal
Audit function which undertakes both regular and ad hoc
reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the
results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
(c)

Market risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market
prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and
equity prices will aﬀect the Group’s income or the value of
its holdings of ﬁnancial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk
exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising
returns.
(i) Commodity price risk
During the years ended 31 December 2017 and
2016, the Group has entered into certain long term electricity contracts and other commodity derivatives contracts in order to manage its exposure of commodity price
risks. Details of the contracts are disclosed in notes 21.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in
market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s longterm debt obligations with ﬂoating interest rates (refer to
note 19). The Group’s policy is to manage its interest costs
by monitoring changes in interest rates with respect to its
borrowings.

(iii) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales,
purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of
group entities, primarily USD but also the Russian Ruble,
Ukrainian Hryvna and Euros. The currencies in which these

transactions primarily are denominated are RUB, USD and
EUR.
Borrowings are primarily denominated in currencies that match the cash ﬂows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily USD but also RUB
and EUR. This provides an economic hedge.

316

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures
that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances or entering into
currency swap arrangements.

The Group’s exposure at the reporting date to
foreign currency risk arising from recognised assets and
liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity to which they relate is set out
in the table below. Diﬀerences resulting from the translation of the ﬁnancial statements of foreign operations into
the Group’s presentation currency are ignored.

The following tables indicate the instantaneous

Results of the analysis as presented in the above
tables represent an aggregation of the instantaneous
eﬀects on the Group entities’ proﬁt before taxation and
other comprehensive income measured in the respective
functional currencies, translated into USD at the exchange
rates ruling at the reporting date for presentation purposes.

The sensitivity analysis assumes that the change
in foreign exchange rates had been applied to re-measure those ﬁnancial instruments held by the Group which
expose the Group to foreign currency risk at the reporting
date. The analysis excludes diﬀerences that would result
from the translation of other ﬁnancial statements of foreign operations into the Group’s presentation currency.
The analysis has been performed on the same basis for all
years presented.

318

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

(d) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not
be able to meet its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due.
The group policy is to maintain suﬃcient cash and cash
equivalents or have available funding through an adequate
amount of committed credit facilities to meet its operating and ﬁnancial commitments.

The following tables show the remaining contractual maturities at the reporting date of the Group’s nonderivative ﬁnancial liabilities, which are based on contractual undiscounted cash ﬂows (including interest payment
computed using contractual rates, or if ﬂoating, based on
rates current at the reporting date) and the earliest the
Group can be required to pay.

At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016
the Group’s guarantee in respect of credit arrangement
between BoAZ and VEB (note 20(e)) is presented as contingent liability and included at maximum exposure for the
Group in the liquidity risk disclosure above.
(e)

Credit risk

The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to
credit veriﬁcation procedures. The majority of the Group’s
third party trade receivables represent balances with the
world’s leading international corporations operating in the
metals industry. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s
exposure to bad debts is not signiﬁcant. Goods are normally sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in
the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured
claim. The Group does not require collateral in respect of
trade and other receivables. The details of impairment of
trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 17. The
extent of the Group’s credit exposure is represented by
the aggregate balance of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial
guarantees given.

At 31 December 2017 and 2016, the Group has
certain concentrations of credit risk as 1.9% and 7.5%
of the total trade receivables were due from the Group’s
largest customer and 9.5% and 19.5% of the total trade
receivables were due from the Group’s ﬁve largest customers, respectively (refer to note 5 for the disclosure on
revenue from largest customer).
With respect to credit risk arising from guarantees, the Group’s policy is to provide ﬁnancial guarantees
only to wholly-owned subsidiaries, associates and joint
ventures. During the year ended 31 December 2016 management have derecognised a provision of USD100 million
against the Group’s exposure to guarantees (refer to note
20(e)).
(f)

Capital risk management

The Group’s objectives when managing capital
are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and
beneﬁts for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal
capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

320

F I N A N C I A L STAT E M E N T S

The Group manages its capital structure and
makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic
conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares
or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital
base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market conﬁdence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital,
which the Group deﬁnes as net operating income divided
by total shareholders’ equity, excluding non-controlling
interests. The Board of Directors also monitors the level of
dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between
higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of
borrowings and the advantages and security aﬀorded by a
sound capital position.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach
to capital management during the year.
The Company and its subsidiaries were subject to
externally imposed capital requirements in the both years
presented in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
(g)

Master netting or similar agreements

The Group may enter into sales and purchase
agreements with the same counterparty in the normal
course of business. The related amount receivable and
payable do not always meet the criteria for oﬀsetting in the
statement of ﬁnancial position. This is because the Group
may not have any currently legally enforceable right to oﬀset recognised amounts, because the right to oﬀset may
be enforceable only on the occurrence of future events.
There are no ﬁnancial instruments that meet the
oﬀsetting criteria in the statement of ﬁnancial position
for the year ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December
2016.

23 COMMITMENTS
(a)

Capital commitments

The Group has entered into contracts that result
in contractual obligations primarily relating to various construction and capital repair works. The commitments at
31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 approximated
USD213 million and USD157 million, respectively. These
commitments are due over a number of years.
(b)

Purchase commitments

Commitments with third parties for purchases
of alumina, bauxite, other raw materials and other purchases in 2018-2034 under supply agreements are estimated from USD3,593 million to USD4,381 million at 31
December 2017 (31 December 2016: USD3,156 million to
USD4,089 million) depending on the actual purchase volumes and applicable prices.
Commitments with a related party - joint venture for purchases of primary aluminium and alloys in
2018-2030 under supply agreements are estimated from
USD6,837 million to USD9,351 million (31 December 2016:
USD5,748 million to USD7,127 million) depending on the
actual purchase volumes and applicable prices.
(c)

Sale commitments

Commitments with third parties for sales of alumina and other raw materials in 2018-2034 are estimated
from USD815 million to USD1,041 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: from USD806 million to
USD1,445 million) and will be settled at market prices at
the date of delivery. Commitments with related parties
for sales of alumina in 2018-2019 approximated from
USD414 million to USD516 million at 31 December 2017
(31 December 2016: from USD546 million to USD680 million).
Commitments with related parties for sales of
primary aluminium and alloys in 2018-2021 are estimated
from USD4,358 million to USD4,770 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: from USD4,450 million to
USD4,618 million). Commitments with third parties for
sales of primary aluminium and alloys in 2018-2021 are
estimated to range from USD1,266 million to USD1,654
million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: from
USD941 million to USD1,252 million).

Social commitments

The Group contributes to the maintenance and
upkeep of the local infrastructure and the welfare of its
employees, including contributions toward the development and maintenance of housing, hospitals, transport
services, recreation and other social needs of the regions
of the Russian Federation where the Group’s production
entities are located. The funding of such assistance is
periodically determined by management and is appropriately capitalised or expensed as incurred.

In addition to the amounts of income tax the
Group has provided, there are certain tax positions taken
by the Group where it is reasonably possible (though less
than 50% likely) that additional tax may be payable upon
examination by the tax authorities or in connection with
ongoing disputes with tax authorities. The Group's best
estimate of the aggregate maximum of additional amounts
that it is reasonably possible may become payable if these
tax positions were not sustained at 31 December 2017 is
USD30 million (31 December 2016: USD225 million).
(b)

24 CONTINGENCIES
(a)

Taxation

Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is
subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can
occur frequently. Management’s interpretation of such
legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of
the Group may be challenged by the relevant local, regional
and federal authorities. Notably recent developments
in the Russian environment suggest that the authorities
in this country are becoming more active in seeking to
enforce, through the Russian court system, interpretations of the tax legislation, in particular in relation to the
use of certain commercial trading structures, which may
be selective for particular tax payers and diﬀerent to the
authorities’ previous interpretations or practices. Different and selective interpretations of tax regulations by
various government authorities and inconsistent enforcement create further uncertainties in the taxation environment in the Russian Federation.

Environmental contingencies

The Group and its predecessor entities have
operated in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Jamaica,
Guyana, the Republic of Guinea and the European Union
for many years and certain environmental problems have
developed. Governmental authorities are continually
considering environmental regulations and their enforcement and the Group periodically evaluates its obligations
related thereto. As obligations are determined, they are
recognised immediately. The outcome of environmental liabilities under proposed or any future legislation, or
as a result of stricter enforcement of existing legislation,
cannot reasonably be estimated. Under current levels of
enforcement of existing legislation, management believes
there are no possible liabilities, which will have a material adverse eﬀect on the ﬁnancial position or the operating results of the Group. However, the Group anticipates
undertaking signiﬁcant capital projects to improve its
future environmental performance and to bring it into full
compliance with current legislation.

(c)

Legal contingencies

The Group’s business activities expose it to a variety of lawsuits and claims which are monitored, assessed
and contested on the ongoing basis. Where management
believes that a lawsuit or another claim would result in the
outﬂow of the economic beneﬁts for the Group, a best
estimate of such outﬂow is included in provisions in the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements (refer to note 20). As at
31 December 2017 the amount of claims, where management assesses outﬂow as possible approximates USD36
million (31 December 2016: USD60 million).
In January 2013, the Company received a writ of
summons and statement of claim ﬁled in the High Court
of Justice of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria
(Abuja) by plaintiﬀ BFIG Group Divino Corporation (“BFIG”)
against certain subsidiaries of the Company. It is a claim
for damages arising out of the defendants’ alleged tortious interference in the bid process for the sale of the
Nigerian government’s majority stake in the Aluminium
Smelter Company of Nigeria (“ALSCON”) and alleged loss
of BFIG’s earnings resulting from its failed bid for the said
stake in ALSCON. BFIG seeks compensatory damages
in the amount of USD2.8 billion plus interest. In January
2014 the court granted the Company’s motion to join the
Federal Republic of Nigeria and Attorney General of Nigeria to the case as co-defendants. On the latest hearing
held on 8 November 2017 the Court has not upheld the
claim and the claim was struck out. In January 2018 one of
the Company’s subsidiaries, ALSCON and the Bureau of
Public Enterprises of Nigeria entered into an addendum to
the original sale and purchase contract regarding ALSCON
on the key terms and conditions as it was disclosed in the

announcement of the Company dated 19 January 2018.
(d)

Risks and concentrations

A description of the Group’s major products and
its principal markets, as well as exposure to foreign currency risks are provided in note 1 “Background” and note
22 “Financial risk management and fair values”. The price
at which the Group can sell its products is one of the primary drivers of the Group’s revenue. The Group’s prices
are largely determined by prices set in the international
market. The Group’s future proﬁtability and overall performance is strongly aﬀected by the price of primary aluminium that is set in the international market.
(e)

Insurance

Where the Group enters into ﬁnancial guarantee
contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies, controlled by the beneﬁcial shareholder of the Group,
the Group considers these to be insurance arrangements
and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Group
treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until
such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be
required to make a payment under the guarantee.

353

ANNUAL REPORT RUSAL 2017

Each of En+, Glencore, SUAL Partners and
Onexim is given an effective right of veto in
relation to any related party transaction (or
amendment to or renewal of an existing related
party transaction).
Each of En+, Glencore and SUAL Partners and
Onexim is given an effective right of veto in
respect of any matter proposed to be undertaken by the Company or any of its subsidiaries which would require a special resolution

re-registration of a private company as a public company; re-registration of an unlimited
company as limited; re-registration of a public
company as a private company; offer to issue

operation of the Company.

The Major Shareholders have agreed that they shall use
their voting and other rights available to them to procure

Shares as part of such placing or oﬀering.

NO MANDATORY OFFER

a general meeting of the Company, if such acquisition or
disposal would trigger a mandatory obligation under the

Buyback to make an oﬀer for Shares and have undertaken
to indemnify each other in the event of a breach of such
undertaking.
