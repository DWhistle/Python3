Chairman’s Statement

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

Dear Shareholders,

UC RUSAL enters 2016 having achieved a particularly notable financial
performance in the previous year, accomplished against a backdrop
of ongoing challenging market conditions. In the second half of 2015,
the aluminium market was impacted by two significant global trends,
the continuing reduction in oil prices and the negativity surrounding
the Chinese economy, which in turn, resulted in the aggressive
devaluation of the Renminbi. Despite this global market turbulence,
global aluminium demand grew by 5.6% in 2015 year-on-year (“YoY”)
to 56.4 million tonnes.
Our performance throughout the year did not occur by chance, but
due to our steadfast dedication to cost management and production
discipline, which is why we were able to announce an Adjusted
EBITDA of USD2,015 million with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of
23.2% for the year ended 31 December 2015. Most pleasingly,
we have continued to see progression across our key performance
metrics. The Company achieved Adjusted Net Profit and Recurring
Net Profit of USD671 million and USD1,097 million, respectively, for
the year ended 31 December 2015 as compared to USD17 million
and USD486 million for the prior year. Importantly, during 2015 the
Company decreased its Net Debt by USD465 million.
The market today is very different from that previously experienced
only a few years ago and RUSAL understands that it is not in the
interest of our Shareholders, or the wider aluminium market, to
pursue growth by increasing output. RUSAL is no longer the world’s
largest aluminium company by production and given the current
market, it is not our aspiration to be. Our primary goal is to be the
world’s most efficient and environmentally friendly producer, both in
terms of cost and technology. In order to achieve this, we continued

14

Driven by Green Power

to invest heavily in R&D and have upgraded our
existing capacities to increase the share of VAP
in our overall aluminium sales portfolio. The close
relationships which we enjoy with our customers
resulted in us producing 96 bespoke new types of
alloys in 2015, at their request. RUSAL’s tailored
offer reflects the strong nature of our customer
relationships, an area in which we are looking to
expand even further in the year ahead.
2015 was the year in which the world’s attention
turned to the issue of climate change, culminating
in the gathering of world leaders at the COP21
conference in Paris. We at RUSAL believe that
the protection of the environment and specifically
limiting the amount of greenhouse gas produced is
of fundamental importance. Currently, RUSAL has
one of the lowest carbon footprints in the industry
and benefits from access to clean and renewable
hydro resources in Siberia. RUSAL will endeavour
to further improve this. Last year, alongside our
total expediture for environmental protection of
USD101.5 million, we announced the following
new environmental goals:
• to achieve 100% of carbon-free purchased
power in our energy mix by 2020 for plants in
the Russian Federation.
• to reduce specific greenhouse gas emissions
at our aluminium smelters by 15% by 2025
from the 2014 level.
• to reduce specific greenhouse gas emissions
at our alumina refineries by 10% by 2025
from the 2014 level.
• to reduce annual energy consumption at our
aluminium smelters by 3,400GWh by 2020 as
compared to the 2011 level.

• to ensure greenhouse gas emissions from
at least 85% of our primary aluminium
production does not exceed the 6 tonne level
of CO2 eq per tonne of aluminium produced
by 2025, including direct and indirect
emissions through the whole production
chain, from bauxite mining to aluminium
smelting.
These ambitious goals are testament to the
importance RUSAL places on its climate change
obligations and I am proud to say that RUSAL has
taken a leadership position in the fight against
climate change. However, this is not something
we can do in isolation, and for this reason RUSAL,
together with other companies in Russia, has
introduced an initiative to mitigate environmental
impacts and help prevent climate change by
creating the ‘Climate Partnership of Russia’. As part
of this partnership, RUSAL will work closely with
its partners to seek optimum solutions which will
enable us to prevent the damaging effects of global
climate change.
During the year, the Board approved a new ongoing
dividend policy, meaning RUSAL will now pay
a dividend at 15% of our Covenant EBITDA. In
October 2015, the Board also approved an interim
dividend for the financial year ending 31 December
2015 for the aggregate amount of USD250 million.
Another important milestone achieved in March
2015 was the admission of RUSAL’s shares
on the MOEX on the first level quotation list.
Listing on the MOEX provides RUSAL with an
excellent opportunity to extend our investor base;
specifically, it will allow local and international
investors who are restricted in their ability to
invest in Russian Depositary Receipts to trade our
shares.

Looking to the year ahead, we believe that
the wider commodities market is likely to
remain challenging. RUSAL expects aluminium
consumption growth to continue at a healthy 5.7%
during 2016 to 59.5 million tonnes as a result of
strong ex-China demand growth in North America,
Europe and Asia. Chinese growth is expected to
continue to also be strong at 7% YoY. There are
no significant capacity additions planned outside of
China in the short term, while China is unlikely to
fill the supply gap as it has also started to reduce
capacity. RUSAL therefore anticipates that the
market will be in deficit as capacity cuts continue.
Finally, I would like to pay tribute to our employees,
many of whom have been with the Company since
its inception, for their continued dedication and
hard work. In 2015, RUSAL celebrated its 15th
anniversary, a period of time where we can reflect
on what has been achieved and look forward to
where we go next. The journey that RUSAL has
taken over 15 years from a regional player to having
a strong presence in five continents would not have
happened without the significant efforts of our
employees, partners and customers. In addition,
I would like to thank our shareholders for their
ongoing support.

CEO’s Review

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

2015 was another challenging year for the aluminium sector. The
slump in global oil prices coupled with a strengthening of the US
Dollar depressed most commodities’ prices, including aluminium.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, the LME aluminium price reached an
average of USD1,495 per tonne, lowest level since the second half of
2009. On the other hand, depreciation of local currencies resulted in
deflation of production costs supporting aluminium producers outside
China.
Against this volatile market environment, RUSAL has reported a
robust performance in 2015 with adjusted EBITDA of USD2.0 billion
and Recurring Net Profit of nearly USD1.1 billion, up from USD1,514
million and USD486 million, respectively, in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA
margin was 23.2% in 2015 as compared to 16.2% for the preceding
year.
We achieved these results thanks in part to our steadfast
commitment to production discipline and tight cost controls. RUSAL’s
primary aluminium production in 2015 was practically flat when
compared to the previous year and totalled 3,645 thousand tonnes.
Supported by favorable external factors such as depreciation of the
Russian Rouble and Ukrainian Hryvna, we were able to further reduce
our aluminium cash cost to USD1,455 per tonne. In addition, we
continued to invest in extending our VAP portfolio with VAP capacity
increasing by 285kt during the period. Our priority remains on quality
alongside production discipline and we will continue to work closely
with our customers to ensure we exceed their expectations.
Much progress has been made to secure our resource base. During
2015, we commenced industrial mining operations at Kurubuka-22
deposit in Guyana and launched the first start-up complex at the
Cheremoukhovskaya-Gloubokaya mine in the North Urals Bauxite
Mine. A further significant development during the year was the
signing of a Multi-User Operation Agreement on existing railway
infrastructure in the Boke province, Guinea, within the framework
of Dian-Dian project. The agreement is the first in African history

18

Driven by Green Power

between the State and mining companies to create
an infrastructural multi-user operational regime
and is in line with our corporate strategy to secure
aluminium production using in-house raw material
supply.
During the course of 2015, we decreased our Net
Debt by USD465 million which, together with the
robust financial results reduced the leverage ratio
to below 3.0:1 as at 30 June 2015 (and thereafter
the leverage ratio remained below the level of
3.0:1 for the duration of 2015). This in turn led
to the decrease of the interest rate margin and
suspension of cash sweep mechanism starting
from September 2015. Further deleveraging
remains one of the Group’s key priorities.

CO2 per tonne of aluminium produced. With the
conclusion of the Paris accord, carbon emissions
and the issues associated will gain more and more
attention from various stakeholders and RUSAL
remains committed to sustainable aluminium
production. As part of this commitment, in
December 2015, RUSAL joined the Aluminium
Stewardship Initiative (“ASI”) with a view to take
part in developing global sustainability standards
for international application in the aluminium value
chain. Development of a standard that would
be an international benchmark for procurement
is expected to significantly contribute to further
sustainability improvement for the whole industry,
making aluminium a metal of choice of the 21st
century.

I am also pleased to report that RUSAL remains
one of the leading aluminium companies measured
by carbon footprint during aluminium production.
Our average direct and indirect smelter emission
rates have not exceeded our target figure of 6t of

Whilst we are pleased with our performance during
the reporting period, the ongoing uncertainty
of the global economy has resulted in market
volatility. Last year, despite the slower demand
and production growth, the aluminium market

recorded a surplus. However, we observed positive
trends at the end of 2015 which signaled that in
2016 the global aluminium market is expected to
return to deficit, with China unlikely to fill the gap
as PRC production has also started to decline. We
forecast that global demand will continue to grow
at a healthy 5.7% in 2016 supported by growth in
transportation, power and packaging sectors.
I would like to thank all our employees and
other stakeholders for their ongoing support and
commitment.

BEMO Project

The BEMO Project involves the construction
of the 3,000 MW Boguchanskaya Hydropower
Plant and the BEMO aluminium smelter in the
Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia, which is expected
to produce approximately 588 kt of aluminium
per annum.
The construction of the BEMO aluminium smelter
is divided into two stages (each one for 298 kt of
aluminium per annum). The start-up complex of
the first stage (147 kt of aluminium per annum,
168 pots) was launched in 2015 and the second
part of this stage (147 kt of aluminium per annum,
168 pots) is scheduled for completion at the end of
2018.

The capital expenditure for the first stage of
BEMO aluminium smelter (capacity 298 kt per
annum), incurred and to be incurred, is currently
estimated at approximately USD1,612 million (UC
RUSAL’s share of such capital expenditure is
expected to be approximately USD806 million),
of which approximately USD1,258 million has
been incurred as of 31 December 2015 (of which
UC RUSAL’s share amounted to approximately
USD629 million). Actual capital expenditure for the
BEMO aluminium smelter in 2015 was USD70.8
million (of which UC RUSAL’s share amounted to
USD35.4 million).

Business Overview

Alumina
The Group owns 11 alumina refineries. Ten of
UC RUSAL’s alumina refineries are located in
six countries: Ireland (one plant), Jamaica (two
plants), Ukraine (one plant), Italy (one plant),
Russia (four plants) and Guinea (one plant).
In addition, the Company holds a 20% equity
stake in QAL, an alumina refinery located in
Australia. Most of the Group’s refineries have
ISO 9001 certified quality control systems,
Ten refineries and QAL have been ISO 14001

2016 thus increasing capacity to 900 kt.
The Krasnogorskaya CHP was acquired in
October 2015. Such a control over an energy
source guarantees stable and cost efficient
steam procurement required for the alumina
production process.
• Bogoslovsk Alumina Refinery. A complex
1,030 kt capacity rehabilitation program has
been deployed.
• Nikolaev Alumina Refinery. The final stage of
the 1,570 kt capacity increasing program has
been deployed with the expected completion
in late 2016.
• Aughinish Alumina Refinery. A number of
programs were initiated in order to optimize
bauxite mix. Blending of BCGI Kurubuka-22
bauxite started in 2015. Placing new gas-fired
boilers in operation in May 2014 continues
to significantly reduce OPEX in 2015. The
caustic storage capacity was extended in
2015 which enables economy on purchase
prices and freight.
• Windalco. The sands removal and second
tube heater projects are in its development
stage. Condensate return project activity was
complete.
• Reduced alumina output at QAL was caused
by unplanned repairs of bauxite and alumina
handling area equipment alongside with a
decrease of digestion production due to

unplanned digestion unit repairs and reduced
bauxite quality.
Bauxite
The Group operates eight bauxite mines.
UC RUSAL’s bauxite mines are located in four
countries: Russia (two mines), Jamaica (two
mines), Guyana (one mine) and Guinea (two
mines and one project). The Company’s long
position in bauxite capacity helps to secure
sufficient supply for the prospective expansion
of the Company’s alumina production capacity
and allows the Company to take advantage of
favourable market conditions through third-party
bauxite sales.
The first stage of construction of the new shaft
of the Cheremukhovskaya Glubokaya pit, that
has been completed at SUBR, will allow to
steadily develop extraction thereby in spite of
the pit Krasnaya Shapochka which is expected to
become exhausted in 2016.
Mining and transportation activities were
partially restarted at Alpart from April, 2015
with the planned increase of export output in
2016.
Intense construction activities regarding
development of the new deposit Dian-Dian
commenced in 2015.

BEMO Project
BEMO HPP is the fourth step of the Angara
hydroelectric power chain, the biggest major
hydro-power plant completion project in Russia.
Construction of the power plant was suspended in
Soviet times due to the lack of financing and was
resumed in May 2006 by UC RUSAL and RusHydro,
a company controlled by the Russian Government,
following the conclusion of their agreement to
jointly implement the BEMO project comprising
the BEMO HPP (the average annual electricity
output reaching 17.6 billion kWh) and an aluminium
smelter capable of producing 600,000 tonnes of
metal per year.
The project’s 79 metres high, 2,587 metres
long composite gravity and rock-fill dam was

hydropower units were put into operation at the
end of September 2014 and the final 9th 333MW
hydropower unit has been commissioned and put
into commercial operation on 22 December 2014.
The total installed capacity of all nine hydro-units
in operation amounts to 2,997 MW.
All nine 333 MW turbines and generators were
supplied by OJSC Power Machines, under contracts
worth more than RUB6 billion signed in December
2006 and September 2007, respectively. The
turbines for the project are among the largest ever
manufactured in Russia by weight and dimensions:
each runner in 7.86 metres in diameter and weighs
155.6 tons.
In June 2015, the reservoir of the BEMO HPP has
been filled to its design level of 208 metres (above
sea level) allowing the plant to reach its full capacity
of 2,997 MW.

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

On 18 May 2015, Norilsk Nickel presented an
update of its new strategy in London and confirmed
its key priorities: (1) refocusing on Tier I assets
(annual revenue higher than USD1 billion, EBITDA
margin more than 40%: Polar Division, Kola
Division and NN Harjavalta, Chita project, reserve
life more than 20 years), (2) Optimizing Value Chain
Footprint, (3) Capital and Investment Discipline, and
(4) Social and Ecological Responsibility.
Financial results9
The market value of UC RUSAL investment in
Norilsk Nickel decreased to USD5,542 million as
at 31 December 2015, from USD6,388 million
as at 31 December 2014. Such a reduction was
caused by the downward pressure on commodity
markets.
In 2015, Norilsk Nickel was running a share buyback
program for the total amount up to USD500 million.
The shares were purchased on MICEX at market
price. The share buyback reflects the confidence
of Norilsk Nickel’s management and the Board in
the fundamental value of the Company’s shares.

On 20 November 2015, the amount purchased was
USD195 million (0.79% of ordinary shares).
Settlement with Interros in relation to
Norilsk Nickel
On 10 December 2012, Interros (which holds
approximately 30.3% of Norilsk Nickel shares
as at the Latest Practicable Date), UC RUSAL
(28.05%), Crispian (5.87%) and the respective
beneficial owners of Interros and Crispian, namely,
Mr. Potanin and Mr. Abramovich, entered into
an agreement (the ‘Agreement’) to improve the
existing corporate governance and transparency
of the Norilsk Nickel group, to maximise
profitability and shareholder value and to settle
the disagreements of UC RUSAL and Interros in
relation to the Norilsk Nickel group.
On 18 October 2014, the Agreement was
amended and the Dividend Policy was modified
(see UC RUSAL’s Annual Report 2014, pages 1820).
In 2015, Norilsk Nickel’s commitments pertaining
to special dividends were fulfilled in advance
(special dividends were paid out during 2014-2015,
including dividend per Norilsk Nickel’s shareholder
resolution resolved in the annual general meeting
on 13 May 2015).
On 29 June 2015, the Agreement was amended
(the ‘Amendments’) and the Dividend Policy was
modified as follows:

Business Overview

there was a reduction in production of Nickel (-3%)
and PGM (-2% Palladium, -1% Platinum) which
was driven mostly by the ongoing reconfiguration
of production facilities at Polar division, reduction of
low-margin tolling operations at Kola MMC as well
as the deconsolidation of Tati Nickel owing to its
divestiture in the second quarter of 2015. Copper
production stayed almost flat.

Group wide
initiatives

Innovations and scientific projects
Aluminium
In its major effort to reduce carbon footprint, the
Company successfully conducted months-long
industrial testing of inert anodes, which completely
eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from
aluminium smelting and generate oxygen, on a pilot
140 kA electrolytic cell. The focus during the year
was on the selection of optimal process parameters
for increasing the anode service life. Along with
testing of technical solutions for improvement
of reduction process performance, research and
tests were performed together with prospective
customers on a unique alloy comprising Green

Aluminium. The research and tests were supported
(co-funded) by the State Programme of the Ministry
of Education and Science of the Russian Federation
“Research and Development in Priority Growth
Areas of Russian Science and Technology Sector
for 2014 – 2020”.
In order to improve its competitive position in the
development and use of the latest technologies
of primary aluminium production, the Company
is completing the installation of an experimental
production facility at the Sayanogorsk Aluminium
Smelter for testing of ultra-high power RA-550
cells with top environmental performance and
energy efficiency. Its target of the electric energy
consumption is 12,500 kW•h/t, including all potroom
bus-bars, which is the best level among electrolytic
cells with a similar capacity. The commissioning
of first electrolytic cells is scheduled for August
2016. Moreover, technical solutions envisaged by
the project will help solve the key global problem
of further ramping up of production capacity and
amperage of ultra-high power electrolytic cells,
to 700, 800 and over 1,000 kA. To support this
landmark project of the Company, the Industry
Development Fund of the Ministry of Industry
and Trade of the Russian Federation has allowed
a preferential loan amounting to RUB500 million
for construction and start-up, while the Ministry of
Education and Science of the Russian Federation has
provided a grant in the amount of RUB170 million for
improvement and further research efforts, supported
by the Siberian Federal University.
Along with the upgrading of existing aluminium
production facilities, the project of converting
the smelters to the Green Soderberg technology
has shown high environmental and process
efficiency of the technology, as well as economic
efficiency at minimum costs. The Company is
continuing the conversion of electrolytic cells at
the Krasnoyarsk Aluminium Smelter, refining the
design for an experimental potroom to convert the
Bratsk Aluminium Smelter to the new technology,
and also performing design work to upgrade the
Novokuznetsk Aluminium Smelter and the Irkutsk
Aluminium Smelter. The new technology allows
to radically reduce the emissions of fluorides, dust
and tar particles, as well as decrease the power
consumption and increase the efficiency.
In order to reduce storage capacity of its landfill, SAZ
has been successfully implementing a cell lining
technology for its C175 cells, involving the reuse of
up to 80% of unmoulded lining materials. In order to
extend the technology to C255 cells at SAZ and Green
Soderberg cells at KrAZ, a lining design involving
unmoulded, recyclable materials was developed

and tested in the course of 2015 R&D. Apart from
the environmental component, the project allows
reducing the cost of lining materials by RUB84,000
per electrolytic cell due to their repeated use, and
also reducing the overhaul cost by RUB6,000 per
electrolytic cell and shortening the period of repair
completion. The next step is applying the technology
to electrolytic cells of BrAZ and IrkAZ.
In 2015, an experimental sulphur extraction facility
was commissioned in the KrAZ fluoride processing
area, which allowed to effectively run the second
stage of gas treatment and achieve the highest
efficiency of gas treatment among its counterparts,
as well as to decrease the hazard level of stored
waste and, importantly, to produce a marketable
product – sodium sulphate. The next stage of the
project will be to try and confirm that the capacity
of the facility is sufficient to cover all gas treatment
centres at KrAZ, to arrange the logistics of sulphur
storage, and to validate the quality of marketable
product with prospective consumers. Also, at the
next stage, in early 2016, an area for production of
marketable products through processing of carbon
components of pot lining – bath for smelters and
carbon concentrate for cement production facilities
and alumina refineries – is expected to be put into
operation. The research for the project is financed
with a grant from the Ministry of Education and
Science of the Russian Federation.
In addition to the completion of environmental
initiatives, NkAZ completed the installation and
successfully commissioned 5 additional RA-167 prebaked electrolytic cells (expansion up to 10 cells) to
replace Soderberg cells. According to the estimates,
the costs of converting Soderberg cells to RA-167
cells should not exceed USD1,600/t, provided that cell
performance is maintained at the level of equivalent
cells with pre-baked anodes (power consumption
equal or less than 13,750 kW*h/t of Al.

other existing producers. It enables the Company
to take its rightful place among producers of ultrahard aluminium alloys demonstrating excellent
weldability and corrosion-resistance properties.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian
Federation has provided a RUB145 million grant
for the development of experimental industrial
production of the alloying additive with a capacity
of 15 tonnes per year or more.
The Company continues expanding its
competencies in the field of wire rod production
from electrical conductor grade aluminium alloys.
In 2015, the Kandalaksha Aluminium Smelter
mastered production of wire rod from 6000 and
8000 series alloys. The wire rod was certified
by major Russian and foreign cable and wiring
producers. The Irkutsk Aluminium Smelter started
the commercial production of wire rod from
aluminium-zirconium alloys and its shipments to
Russian customers.
In 2015, the Engineering and Technology Centre
developed a group of revolutionary, sparingly
alloyed, aluminium-scandium alloys. Having
replaced costly scandium with transition metals,
they were able to produce alloys that were
2.5 times cheaper than existing ones, without
compromising their consumer properties. Product
samples were supplied to European customers for
homologation in order to replace standard alloys.
Also, the Engineering and Technology Centre
developed and implemented a group of foundry and
wrought alloys with high iron content. The Company
collaborates with leading Russian producers of alloy
wheels to replace the traditional 356 series alloys with
new ones, developed by the Company.

To improve the energy efficiency of aluminium
production, the Company has performed R&D of
energy-efficient cell designs and made a decision
to implement various designs of electrolytic cells
at IrkAZ, SAZ and KHAZ, in order to improve power
consumption by 300-500 kW*h/t of Al.

The Company continues expanding its
competencies in the field of slab casting
technology. It has developed and patented a
proprietary technology allowing producing 5000
series alloys with controlled grain size structure.
Shipments of pilot batches of slabs from the Bratsk
Aluminium Smelter to European customers –
producers of casting moulds for plastic pressure die
casting – have been started.

To develop new product opportunities, the
Company has designed and tested a production
technology for an Al-Sc (Aluminium, Scandium)
alloying additive that allows producing alloyed metal
(0.2-0.5% Sc) or alloying additive containing 2-3%
of Sc. Because of the proposed solutions the cash
cost of the new Al-Sc alloying additive is materially
lower than that of its existing counterparts, at the
same time it has distinctive quality compared to

In 2015, in order to increase sales of marketable
products the Company mastered the production
of 96 grades and sizes of new products. The
products have been qualified or are undergoing
qualification with customers. In 2015, to reduce
the casthouse costs and ensure the Company’s
raw material security, 55 various tests were
performed on melt preparation materials and
auxiliary consumables.

Alumina
One of the environmental projects in the Company’s
alumina business was a pilot area that uses the
unique technology to produce scandium oxide
(Sc2O3) from red mud and that was expanded and
improved. The developed technology allows not
only obtaining of the valuable product Sc2O3 with
high economic efficiency and without environmental
impact on the red mud, but also using of the red mud
instead of sandy loam as a construction material for
berms in the mud disposal areas being built at the
Ural Aluminium Smelter, and also introduction of
the effective mud dry stacking technology without
additional capital expenditures.
In order to implement R&D for the technology
of alumina refining from non-bauxite materials of
Russian origin at considerably lower cash costs,
basic engineering was accomplished and the design
of an enlarged pilot facility was developed. The
Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian

Reduction of Costs and Production
Efficiency Growth
• Implementation of the Green Soderberg
investment project:

started. The equipment is to be commissioned
in June 2016.
• A gas engine 14 MW generator unit was built at
Ural Foil in 2015. The production facility is fully
self-sufficient in terms of thermal power during
the 2015-2016 cold season. Power generation
of 4.6 thousand MW•h was achieved in
December 2015. Pre-commissioning work is to
be completed in June 2016.

— The retrofit of electrolytic cells at 4 KrAZ
potrooms has been completed under
the pilot project. Introduction of the
technology across the whole smelter
was started in 2015 with a total of
339 retrofitted cells. Additional 2,700
tonnes of aluminium were produced
following the lowering of the metal level.
Introduction of Green Soderberg will also
allow improved energy consumption,
reduced gross emissions into the
atmosphere and extension of cell life.

• Energy consumption improvement projects
were implemented at all smelters. In the
course of the projects, cell control was
optimised for the minimal voltage and ACD;
the time to ramp up cells to operational
parameters after cell start-up was reduced;
the cathode assembling is being converted
to iron casting. The activities allowed the
average voltage decrease by 20 mV and
specific power consumption - by 66 kW•
h/t. Total effect from power consumption
improvements was about USD5 million.

— BrAZ completed modernisation of 90
cells in the pilot potline with automatic
feeders installed on the cells. A dry gas
scrubber was commissioned, and the
construction and installation work on
two gas treatment centres are at the
completion stage. This activity allowed
elimination of the risks of the smelter
not being able to obtain an air emission
permit. The work is ongoing.

• The smelting facilities using pre-baked
anode technology were switched to unified
anode design, which reduces the cash cost,
improves performance indicators and ensures
the raw material security of the aluminium
smelting facilities. According to the year-end
results, specific consumption of anodes was
532.2 kg/t, down 0.7 kg/t from the budget.

• The investment activity on RUSAL Achinsk’s
sintering kilns conversion to brown coal
is being accomplished. The milling facility
building has been erected and the LOESCHE
main equipment has been installed. The
launch of the facility is scheduled for June
2016, which should drive up the share of
brown coal in the fuel basket to 50%.
• BAZ implements a project of alumina
production recovery to 1,030 thousand tonnes.
Two thickeners were retrofitted; additional
heat exchangers for sinter precipitation were
installed. The construction of a precipitation
unit equipped with higher capacity tanks has
been started. The scheduled work completion
date is October 2016.
• UAZ is carrying out a project to scale up its
annual alumina output up to 900 thousand
tonnes. Heat exchangers for cascade
cooling of slurry have been commissioned.
Construction of the digestion line has been

• Work on introduction of advanced practices
of reduction process control is continuing.
RUSAL Krasnoyarsk is implementing the
“S-8BM Cell Operation Efficiency Increase”
project using best practices tested by
related UC RUSAL facilities. Considerable
improvement of performance indicators
has been achieved in pilot potrooms # 15,
16: voltage has reduced by 37 mV, current
efficiency has grown by 0.7%, power
consumption has decreased by 115 kWh/
t, amperage has increased by more than by
2 kA (without seasonal adjustments), which
helped increase cell output by 22 kg/day.
• In 2015, within the initiative to extend cell life to
2,200 days, tests were carried out with bottom
blocks from high temperature pitch and 100%
graphite bottom blocks; also, testing was
done with cold worked ramming pastes that
contained a synthetic binder and electrically
calcined anthracite and were sourced from
alternative suppliers; a principle of batched
shipments of bottom blocks was introduced,
which made it possible to build cathode

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

15 thousand tons per year following the
purchase and installation of HYCAST moulds.

• A technology of cell start-up without line
load relief has been introduced at all Russian
smelters to stabilise the cell’s heat balance
and to maintain the potline performance
indicators during the start-up period.

• Brochot-2 line was retrofitted at KhAZ to
prevent the loss of the PFA market share
(small 15kg ingots). The project led to the
production of up to 82 thousand tons per year
of high quality foundry alloys.

• RUSAL Sayanogorsk tested anodes produced
from a pilot lot of vacuum distilled pitch. Test
results showed that such pilot anodes have
better performance (decrease of electrical
resistance and oxidisability of blocks,
increase of carboxyl residue (CRR) by 3.5%).
Using such anodes across all the smelter’s
potrooms should improve the anode
consumption rate by approximately 2 kg/t.

• Two thermal treatment furnaces for aluminiumzirconium wire rod were installed at IrkAZ
under “ATsE Annealed Wire Rod Production”
project. Specific properties of such wire rod
find application in a number of electro-technical
sectors. Currently, this wire rod production
capacity is over 3 thousand tons per year.

• In 2015, in order to extend the service
life of the tailings disposal area at RUSAL
Novokuznetsk, a new technology of tailing
removal using the GeoTube membrane
material was introduced. The technology
allowed removing an annual volume of
tailings - around 15 thousand tonnes - from
the tailing pond.
• The programme for improving the silicon
production technology was successfully
completed in 2015: part of reducer was
replaced with silicon carbide. The project
confirmed that it is potentially possible
to increase performance of high capacity
furnaces by more than 20%, to reduce
specific weight of charcoal by 40%, to reduce
specific consumption of electric power by
13%, and to increase output of 2501 and 2502
grade silicon by 17% to substitute for Chinese
imports. CJSC Kremniy has started industrial
implementation of the new technology.
Growth of the share of high value added
products (aluminium alloys) in total output
The company adopted a goal to increase the share
of value added products to 55% by 2020. In this
regard, implementation of the following projects
was completed in 2015:
• Casting pit No 2 was retrofitted; new
furnaces, sawing, packaging and marking
lines were installed in Casthouse No 1 at
RUSAL Sayanogorsk. Production capacity for
of 5xxx and 6xxx series slabs reached 120
thousand tons per year.

The “Helping is Easy” programme

One of the directions of UC RUSAL’s charitable
activity is the development of corporate
volunteering known as the “Helping is easy”
programme. This is focused on the involvement
of employees, their families and other local
residents in volunteering and social help.
In order to involve city residents in volunteering
activities, UC RUSAL and CSP have developed
programmes and technologies. Several
such projects successfully operated in 2015
including the School of Volunteering, the webportal “Helping is easy”, the annual New Year’s
charity marathon “We believe in a miracle, we
create a miracle!”, and a grant competition for
social projects.
In 2015, under the leadership of UC RUSAL and
a number of partner organizations, the National
Council on Corporate Volunteering was created
to consolidate the accumulated experience and
expertise in the field of volunteering, as well
as encourage the development of corporate
volunteering in Russia. The Council supported
environmental action, the international forum
on corporate volunteering and the study of the
status of corporate volunteering in Russia.
Also last year, for the first time, two “Helping is
easy” competitions among volunteer projects
were held, distributing grant support to 101
projects of volunteer groups and organizations
aimed at helping non-profit organizations, social,
educational and medical institutions, children
from orphanages and social rehabilitation
centers, people with disabilities, veterans and
the elderly.

The New Year’s charity programme was
held in 23 cities; Corporate volunteers
from UC RUSAL and its partner companies
delivered 2100 new year gifts on childrens
wishes. Besised, over 6,000 volunteers
took part in the activities helping social
institutions and non-profit organisations.
The “Helping is easy” programme and its
projects were publicly recognized in 2015
with the programme winning the “Leaders in
Corporate Philanthropy” national competition
in the International Business Leaders Forum’s
category, awarded for its “Best programme,
contributing to the development of volunteering
in Russia”.
In addition, the New Year’s charity
programme, “We believe in a miracle, we
create a miracle!” won the “Champions
of good deeds” national competition,
which was organized by the Russian
Managers Association, the Civic Chamber of
Moscow and National Council on Corporate
Volunteering. The New Year’s programme
was also named the winner in the “Best
project, implemented in partnership with
other business” category of the “Leaders in
Corporate Philanthropy” national competition.

The “Formula for the Future” programme

The “Formula for the Future” programme has
been implemented since 2010 and is aimed at
training and developing leaders among young
professionals, supporting creative, professional
and social youth initiatives, addressing
issues of employment and professional selfdetermination of young people, and promoting
engineering jobs.
Over the past five years, youth councils have
been formed at UC RUSAL’s production
sites where their members have been
trained in social projects design, project
presentations and fundraising. More than
12,000 young employees participated in the
programme, and more than 3,500 of them
were active members of youth councils in
nine cities where UC RUSAL operates. Since
its inception, participants of youth councils
have independently organized and carried
out more than 1,600 activities for 50,000
participants, including enterprises personnel,
social institutions, veterans of production,
students and schoolchildren. The programme
held regional forums for the youth that
combined active youth at enterprises and
in organizations of the cities in which UC
RUSAL operates.

To consolidate and expand the programme in
2016, the Company has established a grant
competition “Formula for the Future”. Its
purpose is to replicate successful practices and
technologies of working with young people
and create the conditions for young people
to become real participants and initiators of
positive changes in the city. As a result, 30
projects have been supported so far.
(d)

Social entrepreneurship programme

Improving the quality of life in the regions
where UC RUSAL operates is a priority. It
is demonstrated by social entrepreneurship
programme implementation which creates
good opportunities for the involvement of local
residents in addressing social problems in their
city whilst coordinating all existing national and
regional resources to achieve these goals.
Throughout 2015, UC RUSAL continued to
support and promote social entrepreneurship in
the regions where it operates. The geography
of the network of the Company’s Centers for
Innovation in the Social Sphere expanded from
five to seven cities. For the first time Social
Entrepreneurship Schools were launched in
Kamensk-Uralasky (Sverdlovsk region) and
Novokuznetsk (Kemerovo region).
In 2015, training at the School of Social
Entrepreneurship has brought 172 new
members. Graduates of 2015 started 11 new
social business projects, and graduates of
2013-2014 continued to work on 31 other
projects.
Over 40 organizations are partners of the
programme, including the economic authorities
of cities and regions, business development
and support centers, regional business
associations, banks and employment centres.
UC RUSAL has been publicly recognized for its
Social Entrepreneurship program. The training
curriculum of its schools which incorporated
the social entrepreneurship program won the
national competition of training programs.
The Social Entrepreneurship Program came
second in the “Best program, reflecting the
policy of corporate philanthropy and principles
of social investments” category of the “Leaders
in Corporate Philanthropy” national competition.
In 2015, UC RUSAL allocated more than
USD11 million for social investments and
charity projects.

Aluminium market outlook for 2016
UC RUSAL expects that the global aluminum demand will continue
its growth at a healthy 5.7% during 2016 to 59.6 million tonnes or
by another 3 million tonnes as a result of a strong demand growth in

Driven by Green Power

North America, Europe and Asia. Chinese growth
is expected to continue to be strong at 7% YoY in
2016 to 31 million tonnes. Transportation sector
is expected to continue to be the biggest growth
contribution in 2016 with half of 1.5 million tonnes
growth followed by construction and electrical/
consumer durables and packaging sectors.
Global aluminium demand and supply
UC RUSAL estimated the global aluminium demand
would grow by 5.6% YoY during 2015 to 56.4
million tonnes, an increase of 3 million tonnes
compared to the 2014 level. Within this estimate,
demand ex-China grew by 2% YoY.
The strongest demand growth was experienced in
the Middle East (+5.9% YoY), India (+5.7% YoY),
North America (+4.2% YoY) and Europe. In China,
the apparent primary aluminium consumption was
30.8 million tonnes in the 12 months of 2015, up by
10.4% YoY. Other Asian countries’ growth rate was
moderate at 1.3% YoY, partly due to the slowdown
of the Chinese economy. A decline in demand
contracted in a number of emerging economies
including South America (-7.6% YoY) and Russia
(-7.3% YoY).
On a segment basis, transportation remained the
predominant growth driver globally; registering a
healthy 5% YoY, there was a demand increase of
about 1 million tonnes compared to 2014. On a
regional basis, vehicle production growth in North
America, Western Europe and China topped 3.7%
accounting for an additional 2 million vehicles
compared to the prior year.
Growth across other major consumer segments
of construction and power engineering also
remained firm, recording an increase of 2% and 5%,
respectively.
On the supply side, the industry witnessed
significant capacity adjustments as unprofitable
capacity was curtailed whilst at the same time
previously committed expansion projects came on
stream concurrently. According to the International
Aluminium Institute (“IAI”) and CRU data,
aluminium production ex-China grew by 596 kt,
or 2.3% YoY to 26.292 million tonnes in the 12
months of 2015. Growth mainly came from Asia
(ramp up of the Press Metal smelter expansion) and
the Middle East (delivery of full operating capacity
at the Ma’aden smelter), whilst South and North
America led the decline in production on the back
of smelter curtailments.
Within China, an estimated 4.4 million tonnes of
aluminium production in 2015 was curtailed and 3.7

million tonnes of new capacity was brought into
operation. As a consequence, the net operating
capacity growth of China in 2015 was negative.
On a yearly basis, China’s aluminium production
increased by 3.4% YoY to 2.566 million tonnes in
December 2015, with a decline in growth for six
months in a row. China’s daily average production
of primary aluminum declined by 2.0% month-onmonth (“M-M”) to 80 kt in January 2016, its lowest
level since October 2014.
Aluminum inventories at China’s largest
warehouses fell by 7 kt to 663 kt in the period up
to January 2016, showing good evidence of the
capacity cuts and an improving balance, despite
traditional restocking at the beginning of each year.
From a peak of 1.2 million tonnes in May 2015,
stocks have dropped by 45%.
China’s exports of aluminium semis fell by
11.3% M-M and 13.2% Y-Y to 330 kt in January
2016 due to lower export arbitrage opportunities.
The main driver of the decline was exports of
extrusion, and rolled products which decreased
by 18% M-M to 101 kt and by 10% M-M to 135
kt, respectively.
China has adopted a New Supply side reform
aiming to reduce excessive stocks, shut down
excessive capacity and decrease amount of nonperforming loans through market instruments.
As a first step for execution of these measures
Industry Restructuring Fund was set up in January
2016 and forces power plants in most of provinces
to pay specific fees to support the restructuring of
excessive industries.
Major Chinese aluminium producers have decided
to cut capacity and put further control over
expanding new capacity as well as restarting
already shut capacity.
Aluminium costs, prices and stocks
Aluminium traded within the range of USD1,424/
t and USD1,919/t for full year 2015, at an average
price of USD1,661/t, a decrease of 11% compared
to 2014 (USD1,867/t). Prices were pressured by a
combination of physical and financial factors such
as the global commodities sector in general was
sold off amid concerns over the state of the global
economy.
At the same time, the cost of raw material
and other significant inputs into the smelting
process declined, along with a weakening of
emerging market currencies. These led to an
overall fall in the average cost of production by

USD137/t compared to 2014 from USD1,695/t
to USD1,558/t.
UC RUSAL estimates that for 2015, 41% of ROW
smelter capacity or 11 million tonnes was operated
at a loss at the end of 2015.
Smelter economics in both Europe and North
America were hardest hit and not surprisingly
were the source of many of the smelter closure
announcements.
Current decline in cost seems have bottomed with
even risks of cost pressure arriving from raising
alumina prices in the first half of 2016. Around 70%
of alumina cost components, including bauxite,
caustic soda and labour costs did not decline
together with the alumina price. As estimated more
than 10 million of alumina capacity has been closed
during the period between 2015 and first quarter of
2016.
When considering the “all-in” price of aluminium,
the most significant factor was the collapse in the
regional premium structure. Regional premiums
peaked in late 2014 at an average level of
USD456/t and by mid-2015 it dropped to
approximately USD300/t in value. By then end
of 2015, premiums were trading at close to
historical levels on the back of stock liquidation
by major trading houses in the frame of reduced
premium earnings and increasingly challenging
financing conditions. On the latter point, 2015
was characterized by significant speed volatility in
the forward curve, in part due to reduced warrant
liquidity and emergence of dominant position cycles
within the LME warrant banding.
Considering permanent decline in LME stocks to 2.8
million tonnes, off warrant trend, total stocks were

stable at 9.54 million tonnes in the end of 2015
compared to 9.68 million tonnes level for the same
period of last year.
On the supply side, Chinese aluminium
production is forecasted to grow at the slowest
pace over the last 5 years by 4.8% in 2016
compared to 5 year average growth at 12% and
9.6% in 2015.
The current “all-in” aluminium price means that
around 5 million tonnes of smelting capacity exChina continues to be loss-making. Consequently,
the ROW aluminum production is forecasted to
decline by 100kt in 2016 as compared to 2015 to
26.2 million tonnes. As a result, the ROW market
deficit is expected to widen to 2.4 million tonnes
in 2016 from 1.2 million tonnes in 2015.
Chinese semis export growth is expected to
slow down further in 2016 as compared to 2015
on lower price arbitrage due to a much lower
premium expectation in ROW and higher Shanghai
Future Exchange price linked to local capacity
curtailments.
The total primary market balance is expected to
turn into deficit of 1.2 million tonne in 2016 as
compared to 0.6 million tonnes of surplus in 2015.

The Aluminium Division and New Projects
Directorate are in charge of primary aluminium
production at the Company.
Aluminium Division
The Aluminium Division comprises the smelters
located in Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk,
Sayanogorsk, Novokuznetsk, and Kandalaksha.
Aluminium production
Production of alloys went up from 1,361 million
tonnes in 2014 to 1,400 million tonnes in 2015,
with the share of alloys increasing from 39.2% to
39.8% in 2015.
The following projects were implemented in the
Aluminium Division in 2015:
• A successful implementation of the project
to increase the production of own calcined
petroleum coke, allowing Aluminium Division
smelters to be self-sufficient in terms of
calcined coke supply and cancel purchases
of imported calcined coke for top-worked
pots.
Development of an in-house technology of
primary aluminium production
• The implementation of the project to improve
a high-amperage pot design is in progress at

a pilot area at SAZ: sixteen RA-400 and RA400T pots were started-up; installation of five
RA-500 pots began.
• The project to convert of C-2/3 Soederberg
pots to the RА-167 pre-bake technology is
ongoing at NkAZ: 10 pots, a gas treatment
centre and a feeding unit were installed;
target parameters were achieved.
• The refining of the ‘Green Soederberg’
technology continues at a pilot area at BrAZ:
90 pots were equipped with an automatic
raw materials feed system and a centralised
alumina distribution system; 22 pots received
improved cathodes (type S-8BA) during
rebuilding; and
• The conversion of Potrooms 1-4, 11-23 to the
‘Green Soederberg’ technology is on-going
at KrAZ. In total for the year, 675 pots were
converted.
Energy efficiency
• Energy efficiency projects were successfully
implemented at all smelters of the Aluminium
Division. Implementation of energy efficiency
actions in 2015 helped reducing the specific
consumption of general plant electricity by
253 kWh/t year-on-year.

• As part of the anode slotting area
construction project at SAZ, main activities
were completed; equipment commissioning
and technology testing are in progress; and
• Successful tests of energy efficient pot
designs were completed at pilot areas of
KrAZ, SAZ, KhAZ and IrkAZ-5 for further
replication at other production facilities of the
Aluminium Division.
Increase in production of alloys
• The new Casting Complex 2 was
commissioned in 2015 at SAZ. The complex
will be producing slabs for the automotive
industry.
• KhAZ upgraded a casting line for AlSi7Mg
alloys. The capacity of the upgraded line is 86
ktpa; and
• Annealing furnaces were installed at IrkAZ for
production of alloyed wire rod.
Use of new mechanical equipment in
potrooms
• In 2015, Russian Engineering Company (REC)
manufactured 20 new pot treatment vehicles:
an anode paste loading machine, an endwall crust breaker, a rack-raising machine,
and a crust breaking machine. Projects were
completed to avoid manual labour during
loading of anode paste at IrkAZ and rackraising at KrAZ. An important advantage
of such projects is that it creates a strong
import substitution potential. RUSAL’s inhouse designers both cover general design
and continuously seek opportunities to
use domestically produced parts. The plan
for 2016 is to manufacture and supply 25
vehicles; and
• A project was launched to upgrade existing
stud pulling cranes to make them functionally
comparable with multi-purpose articulated
cranes. By 2026, 86 cranes are expected to
be modernised.
Health, safety, environment (HSE)
• Production facilities of the Aluminium
Division confirmed compliance of their
respective HSE management systems with
OHSAS 18001 following an external audit by
DNV; and
• SAZ, IrkAZ and NkAZ confirmed
their compliance with the ISO 14001
environmental management standard.

New Projects Directorate
The New Projects Directorate comprises the
Volgograd aluminium smelter, Nadvoitsy aluminium
smelter, Volkhov aluminium smelter (all in Russia),
KUBAL (in Sweden), ALSCON (Nigeria), the
aluminium sections of the Bogoslovsk and Ural
smelters (in Russia), as well as the secondary alloys
facility.
Overall, 2015 brought no major changes to the
current status of aluminium production which was
shut down at VAZ, BAZ, UAZ and Alscon back in
2013.

Nadvoitsy aluminium smelter: there is an ongoing
disassemble of potrooms No. 1-3, and the 4th
operating potroom is supplied with electricity
generated by the Ondskaya HPP under the lease.
Volgograd aluminium smelter: In 2015, the
Company’s management decided not to restart
aluminium production. Since July 2015, reduction
cells have being disassembled in potroom 6. The
process of disassembling has not affected the
operating areas of the smelter: i) in 2015, the
casthouse, which started to re-melt solid metal in
2013, produced 42,700 tonnes of high value added
products; and ii) the anode paste section produced
35,000 tonnes of semis, incl. 32,400 tonnes for
Kandalaksha aluminum smelter and 2,600 tonnes
for outside consumers.
In 2015, the baked anodes project with USD109.6
million of investment went through preparation and
entered the implementation phase. The project
is expected to produce, starting in 2019, 96,000
tonnes of baked anodes per year to provide a
cheaper substitute for current Chinese supplies.

KUBAL: The 2015 increase in output against the
2014 level was driven by the followings factors:
i) restarting group 6A (20 reduction cells), which
was mothballed in December 2013; ii) stabilising
process parameters; and iii) reducing outages
(current yield increase by 2.16%).
The New Projects Directorate is also engaged
in the search, analysis and implementation of
projects aimed at increasing the aluminium and
alloy consumption. New projects are mainly
implemented at the mothballed production areas,
namely:
• In 2015, VAZ completed the preparation of
production areas for automotive parts at the
joint enterprise of UC RUSAL and the Israeli
company Omen High Pressure Die Casting
(50/50).

UC RUSAL’s total attributable alumina output11 was
7,402 thousand tonnes in 2015 and 7,253 thousand
tonnes in 2014. The increase of alumina output
in 2015 by 149 thousand tonnes (2%) was due to
the more stable operation of BAZ, UAZ and QAL,
increasing output of Nikolaev Alumina Refinery,
Aughinish Alumina Refinery and Windalco, partially
offset by worse performance of the Achinsk
alumina refinery.

Silicon Production
The 2015 output increase was mainly due to a
higher average annual rate of capacity utilisation:
some of the furnaces were shut down in early
2014, but 2015 saw a 100% capacity utilisation
throughout the year (excluding routine maintenance
and repair shutdowns) and a further increase in
the output (about 1 thousand t.) resulting from
measures for improvement.

• the production of RB paste test samples with
exclusive formulae has been started;

In 2015, a number of measures were implemented
to improve the quality and competitiveness of
silicon production: steadily increasing refined silicon
output from SUAL Kremny Ural, and commencing
production of pure silicon 2002 and 2502. A
programme has been developed and implemented
to ensure 100% self-provided aluminium smelting
in order to abandon Chinese silicon supplies.

In 2015, the amount of production modernisation
investment was estimated to USD4.3 million.

Powders
Lower sales have been largely a result of a drop in
orders from the European Union for coarse powders
(over 80% of supplies to Germany), as well as smaller
volumes of powder supply to Poland and Ukraine.
The key factors affecting demand include: i) stronger
competition from European producers of powders; and
ii) the geopolitical developments that took place in 2015.

Coal production results
The aggregate coal production attributable to
the Company’s 50% share in LLP Bogatyr Komir
decreased by 9.2% to 17,250 kt in 2015, as compared
to 19,001 kt in 2014. The decrease in volume in 2015
as compared to 2014 was due to lower sales of
coal to Russian customers resulting from decreased
regional demand and higher competition.

In the second half of 2015, some technological and
commercial solutions were found to sign contracts
for larger supplies of fine powders used in solar
electricity generation.

Transportation results
Total coal and other goods carried by rail TOO
Bogatyr Trans, attributable to a 50% share
of the company decreased by 2.8% to 6,542
thousand in 2015, compared to 6,730 thousand
in 2014. The decline in 2015 compared to
2014 was due a decrease in the delivery of
coal in Russia, which was partially offset by
an increase in the transportation of coal in
Kazakhstan.

There are ongoing modernisation projects at the
existing powder facilities. These projects are aimed
at improving quality and product mix (RA, RC, RB
grades) as well as increasing the output of highvalue-added products. These include:

• the mass manufacturing of new construction
products (RB) has been started; and
• the product quality (APG) has been improved
by developing a technology ensuring the
consistent quality of lots.

Secondary Alloys
Lower production of secondary alloys is due
to the overwhelmingly negative trend at the
metals market: reducing premiums and prices for
secondary alloys.

Revenue from sales of primary aluminium and
alloys decreased by USD544 million, or by 7.0%,
to USD7,279 million in 2015, as compared to
USD7,823 million in 2014, primarily due to a
9.8% decrease in the weighted-average realized
aluminium price per tonne driven by a decrease
in the LME aluminium price (to an average of
USD1,663 per tonne in 2015 from USD1,866 per
tonne in 2014), as well as a decrease in premiums
above the LME prices in the different geographical
segments (to an average of USD281 per tonne from
USD380 per tonne in 2015 and 2014, respectively).
Revenue from sales of alumina increased by USD26
million or by 4.6% to USD595 million for the year
ended 31 December 2015 as compared to USD569
million for the previous year. The increase was
mostly attributable to a 6.1% growth in the average
sales price partially offset by a 1.2% decrease in
alumina sales volume.

Revenue from sales of foil decreased by 10.9% to
USD270 million in 2015, as compared to USD303
million in 2014, primarily due to a 3.2% decrease
in the weighted average sales price and a 7.9%
decrease in sales volumes.
Revenue from other sales, including sales of other
products, bauxite and energy services decreased
by 19.0% to USD536 million for the year ended 31
December 2015 as compared to USD662 million
for the previous year, due to a 48.8% decrease in
sales of bauxite and a 11.3% decrease in sales of
other materials.

Total cost of sales

Total cost of sales decreased by USD1,008
million, or by 14.0%, to USD6,215 million in 2015,
as compared to USD7,223 million in 2014. The
decrease was primarily driven by the continuing
depreciation of the Rouble and the Ukrainian
Hryvnia against the US Dollar by 58.7% and
83.3%, respectively, between the reporting
periods.
Cost of alumina decreased in the reporting period
(as compared to 2014) by USD130 million, or
by 15.1%, primarily as a result of a decrease
in alumina transportation costs following the
significant Rouble depreciation and a slight
decrease in tariff.

Cost of bauxite decreased by 10.9% for the year
ended 31 December 2015 as compared to the
same period of prior year, due to a decrease in
purchase volume.
Cost of raw materials (other than alumina and
bauxite) and other costs decreased by 13.8% due to
the lower raw materials purchase price (such as raw
petroleum coke by 21.7%, calcined petroleum coke
by 10.4%, raw pitch coke by 11.1%, pitch by 3.2%)
and lower purchase volume in 2015 as compared to
2014.

Driven by Green Power

2014 primarily due to the continuing depreciation of
the Rouble against the US Dollar.
Distribution, administrative and other
expenses
Distribution expenses decreased by 16.4% to
USD336 million in 2015, compared to USD402
million in 2014, primarily due to the decrease in
transportation tariffs as well as the significant
depreciation of the Rouble against the US Dollar.
Administrative expenses, which include personnel
costs, decreased by 11.9% to USD533 million
in 2015, compared to USD605 million in 2014,
primarily resulting from the depreciation of the
Rouble against the US Dollar within the comparable
periods.

Other operating expenses decreased by 47.2%
to USD38 million in 2015, compared to USD72
million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to
a one-off gain recognized on deconsolidation of the
Group’s subsidiary and overall decrease of other
operating expenses denominated in Rouble.
Gross profit
As a result of the foregoing factors, UC RUSAL
reported a gross profit of USD2,465 million for
the year ended 31 December 2015 as compared
to USD2,134 million for the previous period,
representing gross margins of the periods of 28.4%

Finance income decreased by USD7 million to USD23

due to the decrease the interest income on time
deposit at several subsidiaries of the Group.

Financial expenses decreased by 16.8% to
USD1,132 million in 2015 as compared to
USD1,361 million in 2014 primarily due to a
decrease in interest expenses and bank charges
and the net loss from the change in fair value of
derivative financial instruments partially offset by an
increase in the foreign exchange loss.
Interest expenses on bank and company loans in
2015 decreased by USD153 million to USD571

million from USD724 million in 2014 due to
the reduction of the principal amount payable
to international and Russian lenders and the
decrease of the overall interest margin between
the periods, as well as the decrease in bank
charges.
The growth of the net foreign exchange
loss to USD140 million in 2015 from USD27
million in 2014 was driven by a continuing
depreciation of the Rouble and the Ukrainian
Hryvnia against the US Dollar and the resulting
revaluation of working capital items of several
Group companies denominated in foreign
currencies.

associates in both periods resulted primarily
from the profit from the Company’s investment

court decision that 68% of shares of PJSC Zaporozhye
Aluminium Combine (“ZALK”), an indirect subsidiary of
UC RUSAL, should be deprivatized and returned to the
State of Ukraine. On 9 June 2015, these shares were
transferred to the State Property Fund of Ukraine.
The Company intends to pursue all available legal
alternatives, including, but not limited to, the
European Court of Human Rights, to overturn
the above decision. However as a result of the
Supreme Court ruling, the Group no longer has the
rights to vary returns from ZALK or the ability to
control this entity to affect those returns.
The assets and liabilities of ZALK have been
deconsolidated, which resulted in the recognition
of a USD9 million gain. Additionally, USD155 million
of foreign currency translation gain arising on the
translation of ZALK accumulated from 2007 was
recycled through profit and loss.
In August 2015, one of the Group’s intermediary
holding subsidiaries was liquidated. Consequently,
USD60 million of foreign currency translation loss
arising on translation of investments in foreign
assets accumulated by this subsidiary was recycled
through profit and loss.

The Group’s share of profits of joint ventures for
the year ended 31 December 2015 includes partial
reversal of previously recognized impairment in
amount of USD143 million relating to property,
plant and equipment of the BEMO project.

was below a level of 3.5. As interest rates
under PXF credit facilities are determined by
the leverage ratio it allowed the Company to
decrease: (i) the cash and PIK margin under
Tranche A of the USD4.75 billion syndicated
facility and USD400 million multicurrency
credit facility by 1.15% in total (0.65% in
cash and 0.50% in PIK respectively) and
(ii) the PIK Margin by 0.50% under the
refinanced tranche B of the USD4.75 billion
syndicated facility, starting from 03 June
2015. Therefore, no PIK margin was applied
under the PXF as of the Latest Practicable
Date.
• On 6 April 2015, the Company’s subsidiary
RUSAL Bratsk announced a coupon rate
under the series 08 bonds at the level of
12% p.a. for a two-year period, after which
the series 08 bonds will be subject to a put
option and coupon rate revision.
• On 15 April 2015, the Company’s subsidiary
RUSAL Bratsk fulfilled its obligations under
a bondholders’ put option in respect of the
series 08 bonds. 8,067,213 of the issued
bonds were repurchased from bondholders
at the bondholders’ request.
• On 25 February 2014, RUSAL Bratsk entered
into a bond sale agreement for the purpose
of selling up to 5,000,000 (five million)
series 07 bonds, which were expected to
be repurchased on 22 February 2016 under
a put option entered into on 03 March 2014.
Simultaneously United Company RUSAL
Aluminium Limited entered into a put option
transaction which may be exercised for up
to 5,000,000 (five million) series 07 bonds at
a strike price which was the function of: (i)
the announced coupon rate, (ii) the purchase
price, (iii) tenor and (iv) the expected yield of
the transaction. At the Company’s request
this transaction was terminated early in full
and settled on 30 June 2015.
• In October 2015, the Group entered into a
new credit facility of USD100 million with
OJSC Credit Bank of Moscow with a maturity
up to 1 year and an interest rate of 4.30% p.a.
• In December 2015, the Group entered into
a new credit facility of USD100 million with
PJSC SovcomBank with a maturity of 3 year
and an interest rate of 3MLibor + 5.5% p.a.
• In December 2015, the Group through
its subsidiaries entered into the REPO

transaction backed by bonds issued by
RUSAL Bratsk – total being 6,500,000 series
08 bonds and 2,865,475 series 07 bonds. As
result of the transactions the Group raised
funding in the amount of USD100 million
with fifteen months maturity at a rate of
4.75% p.a.
• During 2015, the Group made a principal
repayment in total amounts of USD590
million, RUB777 million (USD14 million)
and EUR25 million (USD29 million) under
the USD4.75 billion syndicated facility and
USD400 million multicurrency credit facility,
credit facilities with Sberbank, Gazprombank
and VTB Capital, including prepayments
via cash sweep in total amount of USD309
million, RUB777 million (USD14 million) and
EUR10 million (USD12 million).
• As a result of the volatility of the financial
and commodity markets, caused by,
among others, global macroeconomic and
political factors, as well as relatively low
LME aluminium prices, management have
commenced negotiations with the lenders
to reset covenants to a sustainable level for
the remaining term of the credit facilities
and to refinance the Company’s remaining
scheduled repayment instalments falling due
in 2016 (and provided that sufficient funds are
available, 2017) of the pre-export syndicated
facilities and certain bilateral facilities. On 2
March 2016, the Company obtained lenders’
consent on the reset of the covenant ratios
of the credit facilities. The Company expects
the approval of the new refinancing facility no
later than 29 April 2016.

Quantitative
and Qualitative
Disclosures about
Market Risk

The Group is exposed in the ordinary course of
its business to risks related to changes in interest
rates and foreign exchange rates.
The Group’s policy is to monitor and measure
interest rate and foreign currency risk and to
undertake steps to limit their influence on the
Group’s performance.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes
in market interest rates relates primarily to the
Group’s long-term debt obligations with floating
interest rates. The Group’s policy is to manage its
interest costs by monitoring changes in interest
rates with respect to its borrowings.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales,
purchases and borrowings that are denominated
in a currency other than the respective functional
currencies of group entities, primarily USD but also
the Russian Rouble, Ukrainian Hryvna and Euros.

The currencies in which these transactions primarily
are denominated are RUB, USD and EUR.
Borrowings are primarily denominated in currencies
that match the cash flows generated by the
underlying operations of the Group, primarily USD but
also RUB and EUR. This provides an economic hedge.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies, the Group
ensures that its net exposure is kept to an
acceptable level by buying or selling foreign
currencies at spot rates when necessary to address
short-term imbalances or entering into currency
swap arrangements.
A detailed description of the Group’s interest rate
and foreign exchange risks is set out in note 27 (c)
of the consolidated financial statements.

5.

The Group’s competitive position in the
global aluminium industry is highly dependent
on continued access to inexpensive and
uninterrupted electricity supply, in particular,
long-term contracts for such electricity.
Increased electricity prices (particularly as a
result of deregulation of electricity tariffs),
as well as interruptions in the supply of
electricity, could have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.
The Group depends on the provision of
uninterrupted transportation services and
access to state-owned infrastructure for
the transportation of its materials and end
products across significant distances, and
the prices for such services (particularly rail
tariffs) could increase.
The terms of the credit facility agreements
impose certain limits on the Group’s capital
expenditure and payment of dividends.
Failure by the Group to comply with the
terms and conditions of these agreements
may materially adversely affect the Group
and its Shareholders.
The Group benefits significantly from its
low effective tax rate, and changes to
the Group’s tax position may increase
the Group’s tax liability and affect its cost
structure.

6.

The Group is exposed to foreign currency
fluctuations which may affect its financial
results.

7.

En+ is able to influence the outcome of
important decisions relating to the Group’s
business, which includes transactions with
certain related parties.

8.

The Group depends on the services
of key senior management personnel
and the strategic guidance of Mr. Oleg
Deripaska.

9.

Adverse media speculation, claims and other
public statements could adversely affect the
value of the Shares.

10.

The Group’s business may be affected by
labor disruptions, shortages of skilled labor
and labor cost inflation.

11.

The Group relies on third-party suppliers for
certain materials.

12.

Equipment failures or other difficulties
may result in production curtailments or
shutdowns.

13.

The Group is subject to certain requirements
under Russian anti-monopoly laws.

14.

The Group operates in an industry that gives
rise to health, safety and environmental risks.

15.

Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources
data are estimates only and are inherently
uncertain, and such Ore Reserves and
Mineral Resources may be depleted more
rapidly than anticipated.

16.

The Group’s licenses and concession rights

The Group is exposed to risks relating to the
multi-jurisdictional regulatory, social, legal, tax
and political environment in which the Group
operates.

Contingencies

The Board has reviewed and considered the
contingent liabilities of the Company and disclosed
information concerning such contingent liabilities in
note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, for detailed information about
contingent liabilities, please refer to note 29 to the
consolidated financial statements. Details of the
amounts of provisions are also disclosed in note 24
to the consolidated financial statements.
Tax contingencies
New transfer pricing legislation was introduced in
Russia from 1 January 2012 which applies to crossborder transactions between the Group companies
in and out of Russia and to certain domestic related
parties’ transactions in Russia exceeding a certain
annual threshold (RUB1 billion from 2014). The new
legislation brings local transfer pricing rules closer
to the OECD guidelines, however creates additional
immediate uncertainty in their application and
interpretation. Since there is no practice of applying
the new rules by the Russian tax authorities and
the pre-existing practice and case-law is of little
reliance, it is difficult to predict the effect, if any, of
the new transfer pricing rules on the consolidated
financial statements. The Company nevertheless
believes it is compliant with the new rules as it has

historically applied the OECD-based transfer pricing
principles to the relevant transactions in Russia.
The new controlled foreign company (“CFC”)
rules have been introduced in Russia starting from
1 January 2015. The rules apply to undistributed
profits of non-Russian CFC controlled by Russian
tax-resident shareholders. The Company is taxresident in Cyprus and managed and controlled
from Cyprus and the new CFC rules shall not
directly apply to the Group in relation to any of its
non-Russian affiliates. The CFC rules may apply to
Russian tax-resident controlling shareholders of the
Company, where such shareholder controls more
than 50% of the Company (starting from 2016
more than 25% or 10% where all Russian taxresident shareholders together control more than
50%). The rules also introduce certain reporting
requirements for such Russian tax-resident
controlling shareholders of the Company starting
from 2015 in relation to non-Russian affiliates of
the Group where such shareholders directly or
indirectly control more than 10% of those affiliates.
Legal contingencies
The Group’s business activities expose it to a
variety of lawsuits and claims which are monitored,
assessed and contested on an ongoing basis. Where
management believes that a lawsuit or claim would
result in the outflow of the economic benefits for the
Group, a best estimate of such outflow is included
in provisions in the consolidated financial statements
(refer to note 24(c)) of the consolidated financial
statements). As at 31 December 2015, the amount
of claims, where management assess outflows as
possible approximate USD37 million (31 December
2014: USD111 million).
In January 2013, the Company received a writ of
summons and statement of claim filed in the High
Court of Justice of the Federal Capital Territory
of Nigeria (Abuja) by plaintiff BFIG Group Divino
Corporation (“BFIG”) against certain subsidiaries
of the Company. It is a claim for damages arising
out of the defendants’ alleged tortious interference
in the bid process for the sale of the Nigerian
government’s majority stake in the ALSCON and

alleged loss of BFIG’s earnings resulting from its
failed bid for the said stake in ALSCON. BFIG seeks
compensatory damages in the amount of USD2.8
billion plus interest. The Company does not expect
the case to have any material adverse effect on
the Group’s financial position or its operation as
a whole. The Company has filed its statement of
defense and witness statements in support of its
legal position. The next hearing is scheduled for 1112 May 2016.

Interests in
associates and joint
ventures

As at the Latest Practicable Date, the Group owns

11 Connected
transactions

The transactions and arrangements summarised
below were entered into by members of the
Group with its connected persons (including
their respective associates) prior to and during
the financial year ended 31 December 2015, and
are required to be disclosed by the Company
in compliance with Rules 14A.49, 14A.71
and 14A.72 of the Listing Rules and, where
applicable, were disclosed by the Company in
accordance with the requirements of Chapter
14A of the Listing Rules.
Continuing connected transactions disclosed in
the Director’s report section of the annual report
differ from the related party transaction disclosures
included in note 30 of the consolidation financial
statements. Differences arise as the definition
of continuing connected transactions does not
include operations with Glencore or operations with
associates of the Group, while these transactions
are treated as related party transactions in the
consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Additionally, transactions that are considered
immaterial and meet the definition of de minimis
are not included in the disclosure of continuing
connected transactions.
The independent non-executive Directors consider
that each of the transactions below have been
entered into and are conducted:
(a)

in the ordinary and usual course of business
of the Group;

(b)

on normal commercial terms or better; and

(c)

in accordance with the relevant agreement
governing them on terms that are fair and
reasonable in the interests of the Company
and its shareholders as a whole.

The Company’s auditors were engaged to
report on the Group’s continuing connected
transactions for the year ended 31 December
2015 in accordance with the Hong Kong
Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000
“Assurance Engagements Other Than
Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial
Information” and with reference to Practice
Note 740 “Auditor’s Letter on Continuing
Connected Transactions under the Hong
Kong Listing Rules” issued by the Hong Kong
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The
Board confirmed that auditors have issued
an unqualified letter in accordance with Rule
14A.56, containing their confirmation that
nothing has come to their attention that
caused them to believe that the continuing
connected transactions as disclosed by
the Group in the annual report (i) have
not been approved by the Board; (ii) were
not, in all material respects, in accordance
with the pricing policies of the Group if the
transactions involve the provision of goods or
services by the Group; (iii) were not entered
into, in all material respects, in accordance
with the relevant agreement governing the
transactions; and (iv) have exceeded the cap.

court of the Krasnoyarsk Province. On 31 March
2015 KrAZ submitted an explanation to the court
together with certain additional documents. On

weather factors, river stream flow rates, hydropower plant output storage, transborder crossflow planning, provision for reserves by power
generation facilities, scheduled equipment repairs,
fuel price fluctuations, details of fuel regime for
“endpoint” power generation facilities, economic
efficiency of bids submitted by producers,

facilities’ equipment, and effect of state regulation
on the market model). The price under these
contracts is derived from the wholesale market
price regulated under the regulations of the Russian

Government. Payments are effected by tentatively
scheduled instalments during each month, with the
final payment effected in the middle of the month
following the month of billing. The consideration
was satisfied in cash via wire transfer.

contracts is made by installments during each
month of supply. The consideration was satisfied in
cash via wire transfer.

Blavatnik was interested in SUAL Partners, Mr. Ivan
Glasenberg was interested in Glencore and was a
director and the chief executive officer of Glencore.
En+, SUAL Partners and Glencore are businesses
which compete or are likely to compete, either
directly or indirectly, with the Company. The
summary below provides a description of these
businesses, as well as facts demonstrating that UC
RUSAL is capable of carrying on its own business
independently of and at arm’s length from these
businesses.
In considering whether the Board and senior
management of the Company are independent
from the senior management of each of En+, SUAL
Partners and Glencore, the Directors have taken
into account the following general reasons, as well
as the specific reasons applicable to each of En+,
SUAL Partners and Glencore:
(a)

the Board consists of eighteen Directors,
comprising three executive Directors, nine
non-executive Directors and six independent
non-executive Directors;

(b)

the decision-making mechanism of the Board
set out in the Articles of Association provides
that all Directors with a conflicting interest
shall not vote when a conflicted resolution is
to be discussed and voted on;

(c)

the Board has six independent nonexecutive Directors with extensive corporate
governance and financial experience and
is able to review, enhance and implement
measures to manage any conflict of
interests between the businesses in which
the Directors have interests and the Group
in order to protect minority shareholders’
interests and to manage the affairs of the
Group independently of the businesses
in which the Directors have interests that
may compete with the Company. The
independent non-executive Directors make
recommendations on proposed connected
transactions by the Company. A committee of
the independent non-executive Directors will
make recommendations to the independent
shareholders on how to vote for any
resolution that relates to future connected
transactions pursuant to the Listing Rules’
requirements; and

(d)

all connected transactions which are subject
to reporting and announcement requirements
under the Listing Rules have to be reviewed
by the Audit Committee before they are
approved by the Board.

In respect of each specific relevant business:
A. En+
En+ is a limited liability company incorporated
under the laws of Jersey with its registered office
at 44 Esplanade St. Helier, JE4 9WG, Channel
Islands. En+ is ultimately controlled by one of its
beneficial owners Mr. Deripaska, who indirectly
holds 91.6% of the shares in En+.
En+’s strategy is to focus on businesses with
mining expertise, including in relation to the
extraction of raw materials for energy production,
electricity generation and the production of nonferrous metals. En+ specialises in metals that
require high energy consumption and then looks
for synergies between its energy producing and
energy consuming businesses.
En+’s origins lie in its core business of aluminium
production. Apart from being the Company’s
Controlling Shareholder, En+ also owns more than
30% in Krasnoyarsk Metallurgical Plant (“KraMZ”),
a plant which produce semi-finished aluminium
alloys and extrusion products.
Independence from En+
Having considered all relevant factors, including
the following, the Directors are satisfied that the
Group can conduct its business independently of
En+:

Independence of the Board and the
Group’s Senior Management from the
Senior Management of En+
The majority of the Board currently comprises
of non-executive Directors due to a historical
arrangement between En+, SUAL Partners,
Glencore and Onexim, pursuant to which they
are each entitled to nominate a certain number
of candidates for appointment as Directors. As at
the Latest Practicable Date, nine of the Directors
were nominated by En+, four of which Directors
are also directors of En+. The overlapping Directors
at the Latest Practicable Date were Mr. Deripaska
(being executive Director) and Mr. Sokov, Ms.
Mashkovskaya and Ms. Moldazhanova (being
non-executive Directors). All of the overlapping
Directors have been elected on the basis of their
qualifications and breadth of experience, as set out
in further details in the “Profiles of Directors and
Senior Management” section in this Annual Report.
The Company’s non-executive Directors attend
Board meetings and provide guidance to and decide
on the Company’s important matters. Certain of the
non-executive Directors also sit on the committees
of the Board and are responsible for the matters
related to such committees.

For the general reasons stated above, the Directors
are of the view that the Group is able to operate
independently from En+, notwithstanding the fact
that nine Directors are nominated by En+.
Based on the above, the Board is satisfied that
the Board as a whole, together with our senior
management team, are able to perform their
managerial role in the Group independently.

Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its
businesses, and operates as a business group
which is separate from and fully independent of
En+.
The Group has, as disclosed under the section
entitled “Connected Transactions” of this Annual
Report, entered into contracts with companies
controlled by Mr. Deripaska for the purchase of
electricity, and may continue to do so in the future.
As aluminium production is energy intensive,
access to relatively inexpensive Siberian
hydropower is central to the competitive strategy of
the Group. However, notwithstanding the volume
of such purchases from companies owned and
controlled by Mr. Deripaska and the importance of
electricity costs to the production activities of the
Group, the Company does not consider that it is, as
a consequence, overly reliant on Mr. Deripaska for
the following reasons:
(a)

(b)

the Group has access to alternative sources of
electricity as the Group’s Russian smelters are
connected to the Russian power grid, meaning
that electricity supplies can be obtained from
various power plants, all of which are also
connected to the grid. These supplies are
available to the Group at market prices;
the Group purchases electricity in accordance
with the Rules of the Wholesale Electricity
and Capacity Market at contract prices
in accordance with direct sale-purchase
agreements with suppliers (both related or
unrelated to the Controlling Shareholder) and/
or at market prices for electricity sold on the
market irrelative to the particular supplier.
In 2015, the overall share of electricity
purchased by the Group’s aluminium plants
from the suppliers related to the Controlling
Shareholder did not exceed 40.2%.The
Group has an option of switching to suppliers
unrelated to the Controlling Shareholder
including by purchasing electricity on the
wholesale electricity market, though there
would be certain price impact;

(c)

none of the contracts is in take-or-pay format;

(d)

the Group is currently already a very large
volume user with significant negotiating
power in the Russian power market. In 2015,
the Group has consumed approximately
28.7% of the power generated in Siberia; and

(e)

the power plants owned or controlled by
Mr. Deripaska are located in remote regions
where there is a limited number of large
volume users located in proximity to such
plants. Sales to distant users would involve
significant transmission losses and, because
Siberia is a surplus energy producer, the
result is that these plants are more reliant on
the customer rather than vice versa.

Financial Independence
The Group’s financial auditing system is
independent from En+ and employs a sufficient
number of dedicated financial accounting personnel
responsible for financial auditing of the Group’s
accounts. The Company has independent bank
accounts and independent tax registration. The
Group’s treasury operations are handled by the
Company’s treasury department, whose functions
include financing, treasury and cash managements
and which operates independently from En+ and
shares no functions or resources with En+. The
Group’s choice of financial institutions is mainly
based on the credit standing of the institutions and
the terms offered by them. As at the year end of
2015, En+ had not provided any security and/or
guarantee over the Group’s borrowings. As a result
of the above analysis, the Directors believe that the
Group is able to maintain financial independence
from En+.
Extent of Competition
The only En+ businesses which compete with or
are likely to compete with the Group’s business,
either directly or indirectly, are those excluded
businesses described below. However, by reason
of the nature of such excluded businesses and the
clear delineation between the Group’s business
and such excluded business, the Group is fully
capable of carrying on its business independently
of and at arm’s length from such excluded
business.
There is no real competitive threat to the Group’s
business from the excluded business and there
is no intention of the Company to acquire such
excluded business.
Mr. Deripaska is a beneficial owner of En+, the
substantial shareholder of CEAC.

131

Directors’ Report

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

132

Driven by Green Power

Mr. Deripaska is a beneficial owner of En+, the
substantial shareholder of the KraMZ group
of companies. Most of the KraMZ plant’s raw
materials (principally aluminium) are purchased
from companies within the Group (primarily KrAZ).
KraMZ’s main customers are industrial customers
located within Russia and abroad that purchase
aluminium rods, profiles, tubes and cast aluminium
alloys.
In addition, Mr. Deripaska is a beneficial owner of
En+, the substantial shareholder of DOZAKL, one
of Russia’s manufacturers of aluminium composite
tape. It manufactures composite aluminium tape
(Lamister, Alumopolyethylene), anodised sheet
and strip for composite panels, strip for soft food
cans and aluminium strips for lamplight reflectors
and lath ceilings in Russia and the CIS. DOZAKL
purchases most of its raw materials (principally
aluminium coil) from the Group’s foil mills and on
market. DOZAKL’s main customers are industrial
customers located within Russia and the CIS.
KraMZ and DOZAKL are focused on the
downstream market for aluminium products, and
not the upstream market on which the Group has
taken a strategic decision to focus. As a result, a
decision was taken not to include them in the Group
at the time of the 2007 merger that formed the
Group because they do not fit the Group’s strategic
profile, which is to focus on more profitable
upstream businesses. CEAC is a geographically
isolated producer of aluminium and would not be of
interest to the Group due to its relatively high cost
structure and certain privatisation obligations. The
Company does not consider the above operations
to pose any real competitive threat due to their
small size, limited geographical reach and focus on
the downstream segment, which is not part of the
Company’s business strategy.
B.
SUAL Partners
SUAL Partners is a limited liability company
incorporated under the laws of the Bahamas
whose registered office is at 2nd Terrace West,
Centreville, Nassau, Commonwealth of the
Bahamas. SUAL Partners is beneficially owned by
a number of individuals, with Mr. Len Blavatnik
being a shareholder of SUAL Partners as to more
than 30% of the total issued share capital. SUAL
Partners is a holding company that holds interests
in the Company and a separate kitchenware and
houseware business.
The Group has, as disclosed under the section
entitled “Connected Transactions” of this Annual
Report, entered into contracts with companies
controlled by SUAL Partners for aluminium sales,

and may continue to do so in the future. These
aluminium sales contracts have been entered into
as part of the ordinary course of business and
pursuant to antimonopoly requirements to supply
aluminium to Russian producers.
Independence from SUAL Partners
Having considered all relevant factors, including
the following, the Group is satisfied that it can
conduct its business independently of SUAL
Partners:

Independence of the Board and the
Group’s Senior Management from the
Senior Management of SUAL Partners
For the general reasons stated above, the
Directors are of the view that the Group is able
to operate independently from SUAL Partners
because the Group’s day-to-day operations are
managed by three executive Directors who are
independent of and not connected with SUAL
Partners and the senior management team, who
are all independent of and not connected with
SUAL Partners.
Based on the above, the Board is satisfied that
the Board as a whole, together with the senior
management team, are able to perform their
managerial role in the Group independently.

Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its
businesses, and operates as a business group
which is separate from and fully independent of
SUAL Partners.
Financial Independence
The Group’s financial auditing system is
independent from SUAL Partners and employs a
sufficient number of dedicated financial accounting
personnel responsible for financial auditing of the
Group’s accounts. The Company has independent
bank accounts and independent tax registration.
The Group’s treasury operations are handled by the
Company’s treasury department, whose functions
include financing, treasury and cash management
and which operates independently from SUAL
Partners and shares no functions or resources with
SUAL Partners.
The Group’s choice of financial institutions is mainly
based on the credit standing of the institutions and
the terms offered by them.
As at the year end of 2015, SUAL Partners had not
provided any security and/or guarantee over the
Group’s borrowings.

As a result of the above analysis, the Board
believes that the Group is financially independent
from SUAL Partners.

Extent of Competition
The Board is of the opinion that SUAL Partners is
not a competitor of the Company.
C.
Glencore
Amokenga Holdings is a company incorporated in
Bermuda whose registered office is at 22 Victoria
Street, Canon’s Court, Hamilton, HM12, Bermuda.
Amokenga Holdings is ultimately controlled by
Glencore, which is a public company listed on the
London Stock Exchange, with secondary listings on
the Hong Kong and Johannesburg Stock Exchanges.
No individual shareholder controls more than
20% of the share capital of Glencore. Glencore’s
industrial and marketing activities are supported by
a global network of more than 90 offices located
in over 50 countries and employ around 200,000
people, including contractors. Mr. Glasenberg is a
shareholder, director and chief executive officer of
Glencore, whose principal business is the production
and trading of commodities including aluminium.
Mr. Glasenberg is a non-executive Director of the
Company and is also a member of the corporate
governance and nomination committee, the standing
committee and the Norilsk Nickel investment
supervisory committee. As he is not an executive
Director, he does not participate in the day-to-day
management of the Company, and accordingly is
not involved in the daily operations of the aluminium
trading division and so does not have access to
confidential contracts entered into by that division.
Notwithstanding that his role on the Board as a nonexecutive Director does not require his involvement
in the day-to-day management of the Company, this
does not preclude Mr. Glasenberg from fulfilling
his fiduciary duties. In case Mr. Glasenberg has
a conflicting interest, pursuant to the Articles
of Association, he shall abstain from voting at
Board meetings when a conflicted resolution is
to be discussed and voted on, subject to certain
exceptions.
When the Group acquired certain of the alumina
businesses of Glencore in late March 2007, it
became subject to a contract for the supply of
alumina to Glencore that continued through 2008,
in declining amounts. The Group sold to Glencore
approximately 34.79% of its excess alumina in
monetary terms in 2015. The Company also has long
term supply contracts with Glencore for alumina and
primary aluminium, and Glencore was the Group’s
largest customer of alumina and primary aluminium
in the financial year, accounting for approximately
37.44% of the Group’s sales of primary aluminium.

Independence from Glencore
Having considered all relevant factors, including the
following, the Group is satisfied that it can conduct
its business independently of Glencore:

Independence of the Board and the
Group’s Senior Management from the
Senior Management of Glencore
For the general reasons stated above, the Directors
are of the view that the Group is able to operate
independently from Glencore notwithstanding that
one Director is also a director of Glencore because
the Group’s day-to-day operations are managed
by three executive Directors and the senior
management team who are independent of and not
connected with Glencore.
Based on the above, the Board is satisfied that
the Board as a whole, together with the senior
management team, are able to perform their
managerial role in the Group independently.

Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its
businesses, and operates as a business group
which is separate from and fully independent of
Glencore.
Financial Independence
The Group’s financial auditing system is
independent from Glencore and employs a sufficient
number of dedicated financial accounting personnel
responsible for financial auditing of the Group’s
accounts. The Company has independent bank
accounts and independent tax registration.
The Group’s treasury operations are handled by the
Company’s treasury department, whose functions
include financing, treasury and cash management
and which operates independently from Glencore
and shares no functions or resources with
Glencore.
The Group’s choice of financial institutions is mainly
based on the credit standing of the institutions and
the terms offered by them.
As at the year end of 2015, Glencore had not
provided any security and/or guarantee over the
Group’s borrowings. As a result of the above
analysis, the Directors believe that the Group is
financially independent from Glencore.

Extent of Competition
Glencore participates in the marketing of both
aluminium and alumina from world markets as well
as from industrial assets in which it has an interest.
Glencore’s subsidiaries own 100% of the Columbia

18 Pre-emptive rights

There are no applicable statutory pre-emption rights

19 Emolument policy

There are no arrangements under which a Director

Basis for Compensation of Directors and
Senior Management
Remuneration policies of UC RUSAL are considered
by the Remuneration Committee on the basis of
an employee’s qualifications and performance, as
well as the complexity of his or her job. Wages for
each employee are generally reviewed annually

and revised in accordance with a performance
assessment and local labour market conditions.
The following was approved by the Board, on the
recommendation of the Remuneration Committee
in relation to the compensation of the nonexecutive Directors, CEO and certain members of
senior management and other employees:
A.

Non-Executive Directors

1
Non-executive Chairman
The Chairman of the Board was entitled to receive
a chairman’s fee of USD400,000 per annum during
the last financial year.
2
(a)

Non-executive Directors
Commencing on 27 January 2010, all nonexecutive Directors were entitled to receive
a GBP120,000 fee per annum; those nonexecutive Directors who were employed or
retained by En+, SUAL Partners, Glencore
and Onexim were expected to consult with
those entities as to whether the Directors, as
individuals, may retain such fees or whether
such fees should be paid to their respective
employing entities.

(b)

Each non-executive Director was entitled
to receive additional fees for committee
assignments at the rate of GBP15,000 per annum
for acting as the chairman and GBP10,000 per
annum for participating as a member.

(c)

The executive Directors are not entitled to a
director’s fee, and they are entitled to a salary
pursuant to their respective employment
with the Group, which is determined with
reference to the relevant experience, duties
and responsibilities with the Group and bonus
is to be paid on the basis of achievement of
performance targets.

B.
Chief Executive Officer
For 2015, the CEO’s annual compensation
comprised the following:
(i)

USD3.5 million per annum base salary, paid
monthly;

(ii)

Annual discretionary bonus at a target level
of USD3.5 million (equivalent to 100% of the
base salary), to be paid within 30 working
days after the Remuneration Committee of
the Company determines the exact bonus
amount, on the basis of the performance
results of the CEO and the Company;

(iii)

Other ancillary benefits.

C.
President
The President’s annual compensation comprises
the following:
(a)

USD2 million per annum base salary, paid
monthly;

(b)

Annual discretionary bonus at a target level
of USD4 million (equivalent to 200% of the
base salary), to be paid within 30 working
days after the Remuneration Committee of
the Company determines the exact bonus
amount, on the basis of the performance
results of the President and the Company;

(c)

Other ancillary benefits.

No emoluments have been paid to the Directors as
an inducement to join or upon joining the Group or
as compensation for loss of office during the years
presented.
D.

LTIP and the Production System
Incentive Plan (the “PSIP”)
On 11 May 2011, the Board adopted the LTIP, in
which eligible participants (being employees of
the Group) were entitled to participate. From the
pool of eligible participants, the Board selected
employees for participation in the LTIP. The
number of shares to be awarded to a selected
employee is determined by the Company on the
“Award Date” (as it is determined in the LTIP
Rules). Unless otherwise determined by the Board,
in its sole discretion, and with the exception of the
vesting of the CEO’s LTIP Award, the awarded
shares and related income for the particular award
period (“LTIP Award”) that are transferable to a
selected employee vest in that selected employee
in installments (which each comprising 20% of the
total LTIP Award), over a five year period (each a
“Tranche”), provided that:
• the selected employee remains an
employee at all times following the Award
Date and on each of the LTIP Award vesting
dates; and
• the first Tranche of each LTIP Award will vest
on the vesting date during the calendar year
immediately following the award period for
which such LTIP Award is awarded.
During 2015, the Board did not approve any LTIP
Award for 2014 and, therefore, no Shares were
granted under the 2014 LTIP Award.
Out of those shares conditionally granted under
the 2010 LTIP Award, the fifth tranche of the

Shares vested in November 2015 comprised
1,338,734 Shares. For the year ended 31
December 2015, Elian Employee Benefit Trustee
Limited, as trustee of the United Company
RUSAL Plc Employee Benefit Trust and the LTIP
(“Trustee”) acquired a total of 698,297 Shares
with a nominal value of USD0.01 per Share.
The purchased Shares represent approximately
0.005% of the Company’s issued share capital
as at 31 December 2015 and at the Latest
Practicable Date.
In June 2013, the Board decided to approve the
establishment of the PSIP, an employee share
award plan aimed at rewarding the Company’s
employees for achievements in the Production
System implementation.
The PSIP is a one-off share award plan and its
objectives are:
• to increase the employees’ commitment to
achievement of the Group’s strategic goals in
implementing of Production System;
• to share the Group’s success with the
employees;
• to recognize contributions made by certain
employees in implementing of Production
System;
• to enhance alignment of the interests of the
employees with those of the shareholders.
No new shares of the Company were issued for
the purposes of the Plan. The maximum number of
shares awarded under the PSIP does not exceed
0.05% of the total number of issued shares as at
the date of the Award.
The Company, in accordance with the PSIP rules,
selected employee(s) for participation in the PSIP
(the “Employee”). The Directors of the Company
or other connected persons are not eligible for
participation in the PSIP.
The shares awarded under the PSIP that are
transferable to an Employee vested on each year
over 3 (three) years.
In July 2015, there were 2,055,740 shares vested
in the participants of the PSIP.
Neither LTIP nor the PSIP constitute a share option
scheme or an arrangement analogous to a share
option scheme for the purpose of Chapter 17 of the
Listing Rules.

1 Corporate governance
practices

The Company adopts international standards of corporate governance.
The Directors believe that high quality corporate governance leads
to successful business development and increases the investment
potential of the Company, providing more security for shareholders,
partners and customers as well as reinforcing the Company’s internal
control systems.
By working with international institutions such as the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development and the International Finance
Corporation, the Company developed and implemented its corporate
governance standards, based on the principles of transparent and
responsible business operations.
The Company adopted a corporate code of ethics on 7 February 2005.
Based on recommendations of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and the International Finance Corporation, the
Company further amended the corporate code of ethics in July 2007.
The corporate code of ethics sets out the Company’s values and
principles for many of its areas of operations.
The Directors adopted a corporate governance code which is based
on the CG Code in a Board meeting on 11 November 2010. The
Directors believe that the Company has complied with the code
provisions of the CG Code during the Review Period, other than as
described in paragraph 3(i) of this Corporate Governance Report.
The Directors are committed to upholding the corporate governance
of the Company to ensure that formal and transparent procedures are
in place to protect and maximise the interests of the shareholders.
Set out below is a detailed discussion of the corporate governance
practices adopted and observed by the Company during the Review
Period.

2 Directors’ securities
transactions

The Company has adopted the Code for Securities Transactions by
Directors of the Company. The Code for Securities Transactions was
based on the Model Code as set out in Appendix 10 to the Listing
Rules but it was made more exacting than the required standard
set out in the Model Code. It was also based on the provisions of
articles L.451-2-1, L.465-2 and L.621-18-2 of the French Monetary and
Financial Code, Chapters II and III of Title II of Book II of the General
Regulation of the AMF and Titles II and III of Book VI of the General
Regulation of the AMF with respect to insider dealing and market
misconduct. The Code for Securities Transactions was adopted by

the Board on 9 April 2010. Having made specific
enquiry of all Directors, all Directors confirmed

Relationships among members of the
Board
Please refer to the profiles of Directors and Senior
Management for more information about the
relationships among members of the Board.

(h) Shareholder Options
Glencore has granted En+ and SUAL Partners the
Glencore Call Option to acquire all Shares held by
Glencore on the date of exercise of the Glencore
Call Option that were also (i) held by Glencore
on 26 March 2007 or (ii) issued to Glencore by
the Company after 26 March 2007 but before
the exercise of the Glencore Call Option. The
Glencore Call Option may only be exercised
by En+ but, following exercise, SUAL Partners
has the right to participate in proportion to their
holding of Shares at that time vis- -vis En+.
The Glencore Call Option is exercisable until 26
March 2017.
The exercise price of the option will be determined
by an investment bank as 120% of the higher
of (i) the market value of Glencore’s option
securities, which is determined by reference to
the enterprise value of the Group on the relevant
option exercise date or after an initial public
offering, the volume weighted average price of a
Share over the preceding five trading days; and (ii) a
valuation calculated by reference to the cumulative
aggregate EBITDA of the Group for the preceding
12 quarters and the discounted enterprise value/
EBITDA multiple at which certain of the Group’s
competitors trade.
(i)

Board meetings at which Directors
have material interests
A.1.7 of the CG Code states that “If a substantial
shareholder or a director has a conflict of interest
in a matter to be considered by the board
which the board has determined to be material,
the matter should be dealt with by a physical
board meeting rather than a written resolution.
Independent non-executive directors who, and
whose close associates, have no material interest
in the transaction should be present at that board
meeting.”

The Board generally endeavoured throughout the
twelve-month period ended 31 December 2015 to
ensure that it did not deal with business by way of
written resolution where a substantial shareholder
of the Company or a Director had disclosed an
interest in a matter to be considered by the Board
which the Board determined to be material. As a
result, there was only one occurrence (out of the
twenty two written resolutions the Board passed
during the period) when urgent business was dealt
with by the Board by way of written resolution
where a material interest of a Director was stated to
have been disclosed. In that instance, the interest
of the Director was a potential conflict of interest
by virtue of the fact that he acted as a committee
member and a member of a supervisory council
for the parent company of the entity contracting
with the Company. On that occurrence, the written
resolution was passed by the requisite majority
excluding the materially interested Director.
Of the ten Board meetings held in the twelvemonth period ended 31 December 2015 where
one or more Director(s) had disclosed a material
interest, all the independent non-executive
Directors were present at nine of the Board
meetings held. One Board meeting was held where
one of the six independent non-executive Directors
was absent from the meeting. Given the size of the
Board and the amount of urgent business transacted
by the Company where Directors and substantial
shareholders have material interests, it is difficult
to rearrange any scheduled Board meeting or
postpone the discussion of such business in order
to ensure all of the independent non-executive
Directors are present. The Board meeting on that
occasion therefore proceeded despite the fact
that one independent non-executive Director was
unable to attend but on such occasion the other
independent non-executive Directors were present.
Of the ten board meetings held, there were four
occasions where an independent non-executive
Director had a material interest in the transaction.
On such occurrences, the independent nonexecutive Director abstained from voting and the
resolutions approving entry into such transactions
were passed by the requisite majority excluding the
materially interested independent non-executive
Director.

4 Chairman and
Chief Executive
Officer

The roles of the Chairman of the Board and the
Chief Executive Officer are segregated and are
independent to each other. The Chairman (being
Mr. Matthias Warnig) is chiefly responsible for
maintaining the effective operation of the Board.
The Chairman is also responsible for chairing Board
meetings, briefing Board members on issues
discussed at Board meetings and ensuring good
corporate governance practices and procedures
are established. The role as Chief Executive Officer
is primarily concerned with the supervision of
the execution of the policies determined by the
Board particularly in the areas of production and
supply chain, financial management and corporate
finance, sales and marketing and others. The
Company has approved a policy statement setting
out those responsibilities to be undertaken by the
Chairman and those to be undertaken by the Chief
Executive Officer. The Chairman is responsible
for leadership of the Board and for creating the
conditions necessary to allow the Board and
individual Directors to operate effectively. The
Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day
to day management of the Group and ensuring
that the strategic decisions made by the Board are
implemented.

5 Independent
non-executive
Directors

Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules requires that an
issuer must appoint independent non-executive
directors representing at least one-third of the
board. In this regard, the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange has granted a waiver to the Company
from strict compliance with the requirements
under Rules 3.10A and 3.11 of the Listing Rules.
After the appointment of Mr. Dmitry Vasiliev
as independent non-executive Director, the

145

146

Driven by Green Power

percentage of the number of our independent nonexecutive Directors is the same as the one-third
requirement under Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules.
The current composition of the Board represents
an appropriate mix of Directors which offers
sufficient independent checks and balances and an
appropriate governance structure for the Company.
As at the Latest Practicable Date, the Company
had 6 out of 18 Directors who are independent
non-executive Directors, and there is no change in
the shareholders’ agreement in relation to board
nominations/appointments (as described on pages
287 and 288 of the Company’s prospectus dated
31 December 2009).
The Board believes that all independent nonexecutive Directors have appropriate and sufficient
industry or finance experience and qualifications to
carry out their duties so as to protect the interests
of shareholders of the Company. One of the
independent non-executive Directors, Dr. Peter
Nigel Kenny, started his career at PriceWaterhouse
and is a Chartered Accountant.
Each of the independent non-executive Directors has
undertaken to inform the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
and the Securities and Futures Commission as soon
as practicable if there is any subsequent change of
circumstances which may affect their independence.
The Company has also received a written confirmation
from each of the independent non-executive Directors
in respect of their independence. The Board considers
that all independent non-executive Directors are
independent by reference to the factors stated in the
Listing Rules.

6 Nomination of
Directors and
the work of
the Corporate
Governance
and Nomination
Committee

The Company established a corporate governance
and nomination committee with written terms of

to make recommendations to the Board, including
those in relation to the appointment and removal
of Directors. The Corporate Governance and
Nomination Committee is provided with sufficient
resources to discharge its duties and its terms of
reference also permit it to obtain access to a legal
adviser.
In recommending a candidate for appointment
to the Board, the Corporate Governance and
Nomination Committee is required to determine
criteria, objectives and procedures for selecting
Board members, including factors such as
independence (in the case of independent nonexecutive directors), diversity, age, future
succession planning, integrity, skills, expertise,
experience, knowledge about the Company’s
business and industry, and willingness to devote
adequate time and effort to Board responsibilities.
In identifying suitable candidates the Corporate
Governance and Nomination Committee is
required to use open advertising or the services of
external advisers to facilitate the search, consider
candidates from a wide range of backgrounds and
consider candidates on merit against objective
criteria, taking care that appointees have enough
time to devote to the position.
The Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee consists of a majority of independent
non-executive Directors. The members are as

independent non-executive Director)

general meeting materials, (ii) the recommendation
of qualified individuals to the Board, including Mr.

of the Board committees, (iv) Board of Directors’
performance self-evaluation.

Nomination Committee have regularly attended
and actively participated in meetings. For the

during 2015, please refer to paragraph 3(a) of this
Corporate Governance Report.

every annual general meeting, one-third of the
Directors or, if their number is not three or a
multiple of three, the number nearest to onethird shall retire from office; but if any Director
has at the start of the annual general meeting
been in office for three years or more since his
last appointment or reappointment, he shall retire

at the annual general meeting. The Directors to
retire by rotation shall be, first, those who wish
to retire and not be re-appointed to office and,
second, those who have been longest in office
since their last appointment or re-appointment.
As between persons who became or were last
re-appointed directors on the same day, those to
retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among
themselves) be determined by lot. The details of
the Directors who will retire and offer themselves
for re-election at the forthcoming annual general
meeting are set out in the relevant circular issued
by the Company.
The Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee also monitors the implementation of
the Board Diversity Policy of the Company. The
Company recognises and embraces the benefits of
having a diverse Board to enhance the quality of its
performance. The current mix of skills, experience
and other diversity criteria of directors, including but
not limited to sex, age, nationality and educational
background, provides for a balanced composition of
the Board.

of Directors’
responsibilities

The Directors acknowledge that it is their

Company law requires the Directors to prepare
financial statements for each financial year. Under
that law the Directors have elected to prepare
the financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards.
Under company law the Directors must not
approve the financial statements unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or
loss of the Company for that period. In preparing
these financial statements, the Directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then
apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting
standards have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained
in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the Company will continue in
business.

accounting records that are sufficient to show
and explain the Company’s transactions and
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and enable them
to ensure that the financial statements comply
with Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They have
general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of
the company and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.

The Directors are responsible for the maintenance
and integrity of the corporate and financial
information included on the company’s website.
Legislation in Jersey governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ
from legislation in other jurisdictions.

11 Internal control

The Company’s internal control system has
been designed to safeguard the assets of the
Company, maintain proper accounting records,
ensure execution with appropriate authority and
compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
The Board is responsible for maintaining and
reviewing the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control system. The Board has overall
responsibility for the establishment and oversight
of the Company’s risk management framework.
The Board has established a risk management
group within the Directorate for control, internal
audit and business coordination (hereinafter
referred to as the Directorate for control), which
is responsible for developing and monitoring
the Company’s risk management policies. The
Directorate for control reports regularly to the
Board on its activities.
The Company’s risk management policies are
established to identify and analyse the risks faced
by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and
controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed
regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and
the Company’s activities. The Company, through its
training and management standards and procedures,
aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control
environment in which all employees understand their
roles and obligations.
The Company’s Audit Committee oversees
how management monitors compliance with
the Company’s risk management policies and
procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk
management framework in relation to the risks
faced by the Company. The Company’s Audit
Committee is assisted in its oversight role by
the Company’s internal audit function, which
undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews
of risk management controls and procedures,
the results of which are reported to the Audit
Committee.
The internal control capability is regularly improved
and enhanced.

(the “Group”), which comprise the Consolidated and Company
Statements of Financial Position as at 31 December 2015, the
Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income,
Changes in Equity and Cash Flows for the year then ended, and
notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for
our audit work, for this report or for the opinions we have formed.

(a) Directors’
Responsibility for
the Consolidated
Financial
Statements

As explained more fully in the Statement of
Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 151,
the directors are responsible for the preparation
and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with applicable law,
International Financial Reporting Standards and
the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong
Companies Ordinance and for such internal control
as the directors determine is necessary to enable
the preparation of consolidated financial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error. The directors are also
responsible for being satisfied that the consolidated
financial statements give a true and fair view.

(b) Auditor’s
responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
the relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing issued by the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards
Board. Those standards require that we comply
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the consolidated financial statements are free from
material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to
obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. The procedures selected
depend on the auditor’s judgment, including
the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial

statements, whether due to fraud or error. In
making those risk assessments, the auditor
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s
preparation of consolidated financial statements
that give a true and fair view in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the entity’s internal control. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates made by the directors,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our audit opinion.

(c) Opinion

In our opinion the consolidated financial statements
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
the Group and of the Company as at 31 December
2015 and of the Group’s net profit and its cash
flows for the year then ended in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards,
and have been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991
and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong
Companies Ordinance.

(d) Other matter

In our report dated 8 March 2016, we expressed
an opinion on the Group’s consolidated financial
statements as at and for the year ended 31
December 2015 that was qualified for the effect
of such adjustments, if any, that might have been
determined to be necessary had we been able
to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in
relation to the Group’s estimate of the share of
profit, other comprehensive income and foreign
currency translation loss of the Group’s equity
investee, PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel (“Norilsk
Nickel”). Since that date, the directors have

obtained the required information and have adjusted
the Group’s accounting for the Norilsk Nickel
investment. We have audited the adjustments
described in note 1(e) to the consolidated financial
statements and, in our opinion, such adjustments
are appropriate and have been properly applied.
Accordingly, our present report on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements as at and for
the year ended 31 December 2015, as presented
herein and approved by the Board of Directors
on 18 March 2016, is different from our previous
report dated 8 March 2016.

(e) Matters on which
we are required
to report by
exception

We have nothing to report in respect of the
following matters where the Companies (Jersey)
Law 1991 requires us to report to you if, in our
opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been
kept by the Company; or
• the financial statements of the Company
are not in agreement with the accounting
records; or
• we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the
Consolidated
Financial Statements
1 Background

(a) Organisation
United Company RUSAL Plc (the “Company” or
“UC RUSAL”) was established by the controlling
shareholder of RUSAL Limited (“RUSAL”) as a
limited liability company under the laws of Jersey
on 26 October 2006. On 27 January 2010, the
Company successfully completed a dual placing
on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of
Hong Kong Limited (“Stock Exchange”) and the
Professional Segment of NYSE Euronext Paris
(“Euronext Paris”) (the “Global Offering”) and
changed its legal form from a limited liability
company to a public limited company.
On 23 March 2015, the shares of the Company
were admitted to listing on PJSC Moscow

Exchange MICEX-RTS (“Moscow Exchange”) in
the First Level quotation list. The trading of shares
on Moscow Exchange commenced on 30 March
2015. There was no issue of new shares.
The Company’s registered office is 44 Esplanade,
St Helier, Jersey, JE4 9WG.
The Company directly or through its wholly owned
subsidiaries controls a number of production and
trading entities (refer to note 31) engaged in the
aluminium business and other entities, which
together with the Company are referred to as “the
Group”.
Upon successful completion of the Global Offering,
the Company issued 1,636,363,646 new shares in
the form of shares listed on the Stock Exchange,
and in the form of global depositary shares (“GDS”)
listed on Euronext Paris representing 10.81% of
the Company’s issued and outstanding shares,
immediately prior to the Global Offering.
The shareholding structure of the Company as at
31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 was as

incentive plan (“LTIP”) (note 21(b)).

Related party transactions and controlling parties
are disclosed in notes 30 and 32, respectively.
(b) Deconsolidation of subsidiaries
On 11 March 2015, the Supreme Court of Ukraine
denied the Group’s appeal to reconsider the

167

Financial Statements

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

Driven by Green Power

168

previous court decision that 68% of shares of
PJSC Zaporozhye Aluminium Combine (‘ZALK’),
an indirect subsidiary of UC RUSAL PLc, should be
deprivatized and returned to the State of Ukraine.
On 9 June 2015 ZALK shares were written off the
Company’s account and transferred to the State of
Ukraine.
The Company intends to pursue all available legal
alternatives, including, but not limited to, the
European Court on Human Rights, to overturn
the above decision. However as a result of the
Supreme Court ruling the Group no longer has the
rights to varying returns from ZALK or the ability to
control this entity to affect those returns.
The assets and liabilities of ZALK have been
deconsolidated which resulted in recognition of
USD9 million gain in these consolidated financial
statements. Additionally, USD155 million of foreign
currency translation gain arising on the translation
of ZALK accumulated from 2007 was recycled
through profit and loss.
In August 2015 one of the Group’s intermediary
holding subsidiaries was liquidated. Consequently,
USD60 million of foreign currency translation loss
arising on translation of investments in foreign
assets accumulated by this subsidiary was recycled
through profit and loss.
(c) Operations
The Group operates in the aluminium industry
primarily in the Russian Federation, Ukraine,
Guinea, Jamaica, Ireland, Italy, Nigeria and Sweden
and is principally engaged in the mining and
refining of bauxite and nepheline ore into alumina,
the smelting of primary aluminium from alumina
and the fabrication of aluminium and aluminium
alloys into semi-fabricated and finished products.
The Group sells its products primarily in Europe,
Russia, other countries of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (“CIS”), Asia and North
America.
(d)

Business environment in emerging
economies
The Russian Federation, Ukraine, Jamaica, Nigeria
and Guinea have been experiencing political and
economic changes that have affected, and may
continue to affect, the activities of enterprises
operating in these environments. Consequently,
operations in these countries involve risks that
typically do not exist in other markets, including
reconsideration of privatisation terms in certain
countries where the Group operates following
changes in governing political powers.

The conflict in Ukraine and related events has
increased the perceived risks of doing business in
the Russian Federation. The imposition of economic
sanctions on Russian individuals and legal entities
by the European Union, the United States of
America, Japan, Canada, Australia and others, as
well as retaliatory sanctions imposed by the Russian
government, has resulted in increased economic
uncertainty including more volatile equity markets,
a depreciation of the Russian Rouble, a reduction in
both local and foreign direct investment inflows and
a significant tightening in the availability of credit. In
particular, some Russian entities may be experiencing
difficulties in accessing international equity and debt
markets and may become increasingly dependent
on Russian state banks to finance their operations.
The longer term effects of recently implemented
sanctions, as well as the threat of additional future
sanctions, are difficult to determine.
The consolidated financial statements reflect
management’s assessment of the impact of the
Russian, Ukrainian, Jamaican, Nigerian and Guinean
business environments on the operations and the
financial position of the Group. The future business
environment may differ from management’s
assessment.
Previously issued Consolidated Financial
Statements as at and for the year ended
31 December 2015
The Group has previously issued consolidated
financial statements as at and for the year ended
31 December 2015 dated 8 March 2016. At that
date the Group was unable to obtain consolidated
IFRS financial statements of the Group’s significant
equity investee, PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel, as
at and for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Consequently the Group estimated its share in
the profits and other comprehensive income of
PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel for the year ended
31 December 2015 based on publicly available
information at that time. On 15 March 2016 PJSC
MMC Norilsk Nickel published its IFRS consolidated
financial statements and management reassessed
its share in the profits and other comprehensive
income of PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel based on this
information. As a result, management concluded
that foreign currency translation differences
of equity accounted investees and interests in
associates were each understated by USD1,060
million, in the Group’s previously issued consolidated
financial statements as at and for the year ended 31
December 2015 dated 8 March 2016.
These consolidated financial statements as at and
for the year ended 31 December 2015 have been
adjusted accordingly.

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

(a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), which collective
term includes all International Accounting Standards
and related interpretations, promulgated by the
International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”),
and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong
Companies Ordinance.
These financial statements also comply with
the applicable disclosure provisions of the Rules
Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.
The IASB has issued a number of new and
revised IFRSs. For the purpose of preparing these
consolidated financial statements, the Group has
adopted all these new and revised IFRSs, except
for any new standards or interpretations that
are not yet effective as at 31 December 2015.
The revised and new accounting standards and
interpretations issued but not yet effective for the
accounting year beginning on 1 January 2015 are
set out in note 36.
(b) Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the historical cost
basis except as set out in the significant accounting
policy in note 3(c) below.

consolidated financial statements, and the reported
revenue and costs during the relevant period.
Management bases its judgements and estimates
on historical experience and various other factors
that are believed to be appropriate and reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis of making the judgements about
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to
accounting estimates are recognised in the period
in which the estimate is revised if the revision
affects only that period, or in the period of the
revision and future periods if the revision affects
both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the
application of IFRSs that have a significant effect on
the consolidated financial statements and estimates
with a significant risk of material adjustment in the
next year are discussed in note 35.
(e)

Changes in accounting policies and
presentation
The accounting policies and judgements applied
by the Group in these consolidated financial
statements are the same as those applied by the
Group in its consolidated financial statements as at
and for the year ended 31 December 2014.

(c) Functional and presentation currency
The Company’s functional currency is the United
States Dollar (“USD”) because it reflects the
economic substance of the underlying events and
circumstances of the Company. The functional
currencies of the Group’s significant subsidiaries
are the currencies of the primary economic
environment and key business processes of these
subsidiaries and include USD, Russian Roubles
(“RUB”), Ukrainian Hryvna and Euros (“EUR”). The
consolidated financial statements are presented
in USD, rounded to the nearest million, except as
otherwise stated herein.

policies

(d)

(a)

Use of judgements, estimates and
assumptions
The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with IFRSs requires management to
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that
affect the application of accounting policies and
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the

The following significant accounting policies have
been applied in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements. These accounting policies
have been consistently applied to all periods
presented in these consolidated financial
statements.

(i)

Basis of consolidation

Subsidiaries and non-controlling
interests
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement
with the entity and has the ability to affect those

returns through its power over the entity. When
assessing whether the Group has power, only
substantive rights (held by the Group and other
parties) are considered.

regarded as the fair value on initial recognition of a
financial asset (see note 3(c)) or, when appropriate,
the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an
associate or joint venture (see note 3(a (iv)).

An investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into
the consolidated financial statements from the date
that control commences until the date that control
ceases. Intra-group balances, transactions and cash
flows and any unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in full in preparing
the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised
losses resulting from intra-group transactions are
eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains
but only to the extent that there is no evidence of
impairment.

In the company’s statement of financial position,
an investment in a subsidiary is stated at cost
less impairment losses, unless the investment is
classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal
group that is classified as held for sale).

Non-controlling interests represent the equity in a
subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to
the Company, and in respect of which the Group
has not agreed any additional terms with the
holders of those interests which would result in the
Group as a whole having a contractual obligation
in respect of those interests that meets the
definition of a financial liability. For each business
combination, the Group can elect to measure any
non-controlling interests either at fair value or at the
non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the
subsidiary’s net identifiable assets.
Non-controlling interests are presented in the
consolidated statement of financial position
within equity, separately from equity attributable
to the equity shareholders of the company. Noncontrolling interests in the results of the group are
presented on the face of the consolidated statement
of profit or loss and the consolidated statement
of profit or loss and other comprehensive income
as an allocation of the total profit or loss and total
comprehensive income for the year between noncontrolling interests and the equity shareholders of
the Company.
Changes in the Group’s interests in a subsidiary
that do not result in a loss of control are accounted
for as equity transactions, whereby adjustments
are made to the amounts of controlling and noncontrolling interests within consolidated equity
to reflect the change in relative interests, but no
adjustments are made to goodwill and no gain or
loss is recognised.
When the group loses control of a subsidiary, it is
accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in
that subsidiary, with a resulting gain or loss being
recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained
in that former subsidiary at the date when control
is lost is recognised at fair value and this amount is

(ii)

Acquisitions of non-controlling
interests
The acquisition of an additional non-controlling
interest in an existing subsidiary after control
has been obtained is accounted for as an equity
transaction with any difference between the cost of
the additional investment and the carrying amount
of the net assets acquired at the date of exchange
recognised directly in equity.
(iii)

Acquisitions from entities under
common control
Business combinations arising from transfers of
interests in entities that are under the common
control of the shareholder that controls the
Company are accounted for as if the acquisition
had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period
presented or, if later, at the date that common
control was established. The assets and liabilities
acquired are recognised at the carrying amounts
recognised previously in the Group’s controlling
shareholder’s consolidated financial statements.
The components of the equity of the acquired
entities are added to the same components within
Group equity except that any share capital of the
acquired entities is recognised as part of additional
paid-in capital. Any cash paid for the acquisition is
recognised directly in equity.
(iv)

Associates and joint ventures (equity
accounted investees)
An associate is an entity in which the Group or
Company has significant influence, but not control
or joint control, over its management, including
participation in the financial and operating policy
decisions.
A joint venture is an arrangement whereby the
Group or Company and other parties contractually
agree to share control of the arrangement, and
have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.
An investment in an associate or a joint venture
is accounted for in the consolidated financial
statements under the equity method, unless it is
classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal
group that is classified as held for sale) (see note

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest
in the associate or the joint venture, the Group’s
interest is reduced to nil and recognition of further
losses is discontinued except to the extent that the
Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or
made payments on behalf of the investee.
Unrealised profits and losses resulting from
transactions between the Group and its associates
and joint venture are eliminated to the extent of
the group’s interest in the investee, except where
unrealised losses provide evidence of an impairment
of the asset transferred, in which case they are
recognised immediately in profit or loss.
If an investment in an associate becomes an
investment in a joint venture or vice versa, retained
interest is not remeasured. Instead, the investment
continues to be accounted for under the equity
method.
In all other cases, when the group ceases to have
significant influence over an associate or joint
control over a joint venture, it is accounted for as a
disposal of the entire interest in that investee, with
a resulting gain or loss being recognised in profit or
loss. Any interest retained in that former investee at
the date when significant influence or joint control
is lost is recognised at fair value and this amount is
regarded as the fair value on initial recognition of a
financial asset (see note 3(c)).
In the Company’s statement of financial position,
investments in associates and joint venture are
stated at cost less impairment losses, unless
classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal
group that is classified as held for sale).

(v)

Transactions eliminated on
consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any
unrealised income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the
consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains
arising from transactions with equity accounted
investees are eliminated against the investment to
the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way
as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that
there is no evidence of impairment.
(b)

Foreign currencies

(i)
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated
into the respective functional currencies of Group
entities at the exchange rates ruling at the dates
of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting
date are retranslated to the functional currency at
the exchange rate at that date. The foreign currency
gain or loss on monetary items is the difference
between the amortised cost in the functional
currency at the beginning of the period, adjusted
for effective interest and payments during the
period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency
translated at the exchange rate at the end of the
reporting period. Non-monetary items in a foreign
currency are measured based on historical cost are
translated using the exchange rate at the date of
transaction. Foreign currency differences arising
on retranslation are recognised in the statement
of income, except for differences arising on the
retranslation of qualifying cash flow hedges to the
extent the hedge is effective, which is recognised
in the other comprehensive income.
(ii) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations,
including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising
on acquisition, are translated from their functional
currencies to USD at the exchange rates ruling
at the reporting date. The income and expenses
of foreign operations are translated to USD at
exchange rates approximating exchange rates at
the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences arising on translation
are recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income and presented in the currency translation
reserve in equity. For the purposes of foreign
currency translation, the net investment in a
foreign operation includes foreign currency intra-

Financial Statements

1(b)). Under the equity method, the investment is
initially recorded at cost, adjusted for any excess
of the Group’s share of the acquisition-date fair
values of the investee’s identifiable net assets
over the cost of the investment (if any). Thereafter,
the investment is adjusted for the post acquisition
change in the Group’s share of the investee’s net
assets and any impairment loss relating to the
investment. Any acquisition-date excess over cost,
the Group’s share of the post-acquisition, post-tax
results of the investees and any impairment losses
for the year are recognised in the consolidated
statement of profit or loss, whereas the Group’s
share of the post-acquisition post-tax items of
the investees’ other comprehensive income is
recognised in the consolidated statement of other
comprehensive income.

171

172

group balances for which settlement is neither
planned nor likely in the foreseeable future and
foreign currency differences arising from such a
monetary item are recognised in the statement of
comprehensive income.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, such that
control, significant influence or joint control is lost,
the cumulative amount of the currency translation
reserve is transferred to the statement of income
as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the
Group disposes of only part of its interest in a
subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while
retaining control, the relevant proportion of the
cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling
interests. When the Group disposes of only part
of its investment in an associate or joint venture
that includes a foreign operation while retaining
significant influence or joint control, the relevant
proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified
to the statement of income.
(c)

Financial instruments

(i)
Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise
investments in securities, trade and other
receivables (excluding prepayments and tax assets),
cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings
and trade and other payables (excluding advances
received and tax liabilities).
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised
initially at fair value plus any directly attributable
transaction costs.
A financial instrument is recognised when
the Group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are
derecognised if the Group’s contractual rights to
the cash flows from the financial assets expire or
if the Group transfers the financial asset to another
party without retaining control or substantially all
risks and rewards of the asset. Financial liabilities
are derecognised if the Group’s obligations
specified in the contract expire or are discharged or
cancelled.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the
net amount presented in the statement of financial
position when, and only when, the Group has a
legal right to offset the amounts and intends either
to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and
settle the liability simultaneously.
Subsequent to initial recognition non-derivative
financial instruments are measured as described
below.

Held-to-maturity investments
If the Group has the positive intent and ability to
hold securities to maturity, then they are classified
as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments
are measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less any impairment losses (refer
to note 3(h) (i)).
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash
balances and call deposits with maturities at initial
recognition of three months or less that are subject
to insignificant risk of changes in their fair values,
and are used by the Group in the management of
its short-term commitments.
Others
Other non-derivative financial instruments are
measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less any impairment losses (refer
to note 3(h) (i)). Investments in equity securities
that are not quoted on a stock exchange and where
fair value cannot be estimated on a reasonable
basis by other means are stated at cost less
impairment losses (refer to note 3(h) (i)).
Non-derivative financial liabilities
The Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities,
subsequent to initial recognition, are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
(ii)

Derivative financial instruments,
including hedge accounting
The Group enters, from time to time, into various
derivative financial instruments to manage its
exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency
risk and interest rate risk.
Embedded derivatives are separated from the
host contract and accounted for separately if
the economic characteristics and risks of the
host contract and the embedded derivative are
not closely related, a separate instrument with
the same terms as the embedded derivative
would meet the definition of a derivative and the
combined instrument is not measured at fair value
through profit or loss.
On initial designation of the derivative as a hedging
instrument, the Group formally documents the
relationship between the hedging instrument
and hedged item, including the risk management
objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge
transaction and the hedged risk, together with
the methods that will be used to assess the
effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group
makes an assessment, both at the inception of the
hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis,

of whether the hedging instruments are expected
to be highly effective in offsetting the changes
in the fair value or cash flows of the respective
hedged items attributable to the hedged risk, and
whether the actual results of each hedge are within
a range of 80% - 125%. For a cash flow hedge of
a forecast transaction, the transaction should be
highly probable to occur and should present an
exposure to variation in cash flows that ultimately
could affect reported profit or loss.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value;
attributable transaction costs are recognised in the
statement of income when incurred. Subsequent to
initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair
value.
The measurement of fair value of derivative
financial instruments, including embedded
derivatives, is based on quoted market prices.
Where no price information is available from
a quoted market source, alternative market
mechanisms or recent comparable transactions,
fair value is estimated based on the Group’s
views on relevant future prices, net of valuation
allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling
and other risks implicit in such estimates.
Changes in the fair value therein are accounted
for as described below.
When a derivative is designated as the hedging
instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash
flows attributable to a particular risk associated with
a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable
forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss,
the effective portion of changes in the fair value
of the derivative is recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income and presented in the
hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion
of changes in the fair value of a derivative is
recognised in the statement of income.
When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the
amount accumulated in equity is included in the
carrying amount of the asset when the asset is
recognised. In other cases, the amount accumulated
in equity is reclassified to the statement of income
in the same period that the hedged item affects
profit or loss. If the hedging instrument no longer
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or
is sold, terminated or exercised, or the designation
is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued
prospectively. If the forecast transaction is no
longer expected to occur, then the balance in equity
is reclassified to the statement of income.
Changes in the fair value of separated embedded
derivatives and derivative financial instruments

not designated for hedge accounting are
recognised immediately in the statement of
income.
(d)

Property, plant and equipment

(i)
Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment, are
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation
and impairment losses. The cost of property, plant
and equipment at 1 January 2004, the date of
transition to IFRSs, was determined by reference
to its fair value at that date.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly
attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The
cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost
of materials and direct labour, any other costs
directly attributable to bringing the asset to a
working condition for its intended use, the costs of
dismantling and removing the items and restoring
the site on which they are located and capitalised
borrowing costs (refer to note 3(gg)). Purchased
software that is integral to the functionality of the
related equipment is capitalised as part of that
equipment.
When parts of an item of property, plant and
equipment have different useful lives, they
are accounted for as separate items (major
components) of property, plant and equipment.
The cost of periodic relining of electrolysers is
capitalised and depreciated over the expected
production period.
Gains or losses on disposal of an item of property,
plant and equipment are determined by comparing
the proceeds from disposal with the carrying
amount of property, plant and equipment, and are
recognised net within gain/(loss) on disposal of
property, plant and equipment in the statement of
income.
(ii) Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing a part of an item of property,
plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying
amount of the item if it is probable that the future
economic benefits embodied within the part will
flow to the Group and its cost can be measured
reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is
derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing
of property, plant and equipment are recognised in
the statement of income as incurred.
(iii) Exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation activities involve the
search for mineral resources, the determination

of technical feasibility and the assessment of
commercial viability of an identified resource.
Exploration and evaluation activities include:

Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to
mining property, plant and equipment or intangible
assets when development is sanctioned.

• researching and analysing historical
exploration data;

(iv) Stripping costs
Expenditure relating to the stripping of overburden
layers of ore, including estimated site restoration
costs, is included in the cost of production in the
period in which it is incurred.

• gathering exploration data through
topographical, geochemical and geophysical
studies;
• exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;
• determining and examining the volume and
grade of the resource;
• surveying transportation and infrastructure
requirements; and
• conducting market and finance studies.
Administration costs that are not directly
attributable to a specific exploration area are
charged to the statement of income.
License costs paid in connection with a right
to explore in an existing exploration area are
capitalised and amortised over the term of the
permit.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised
as exploration and evaluation assets when it is
expected that expenditure related to an area of
interest will be recouped by future exploitation,
sale, or, at the reporting date, the exploration and
evaluation activities have not reached a stage that
permits a reasonable assessment of the existence
of commercially recoverable ore reserves.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure
is recorded as a component of property, plant
and equipment at cost less impairment losses.
As the asset is not available for use, it is not
depreciated. All capitalised exploration and
evaluation expenditure is monitored for indications
of impairment. Where there are indicators of
potential impairment, an assessment is performed
for each area of interest in conjunction with the
group of operating assets (representing a cashgenerating unit) to which the exploration is
attributed. Exploration areas at which reserves
have been discovered but which require major
capital expenditure before production can begin are
continually evaluated to ensure that commercial
quantities of reserves exist or to ensure that
additional exploration work is underway or planned.
To the extent that capitalised expenditure is not
expected to be recovered it is charged to the
statement of income.

(v) Mining assets
Mining assets are recorded as construction in
progress and transferred to mining property,
plant and equipment when a new mine reaches
commercial production.
Mining assets include expenditure incurred for:
• Acquiring mineral and development rights;
• Developing new mining operations.
Mining assets include interest capitalised during the
construction period, when financed by borrowings.
(vi) Depreciation
The carrying amounts of property, plant and
equipment (including initial and any subsequent
capital expenditure) are depreciated to their
estimated residual value over the estimated useful
lives of the specific assets concerned, or the
estimated life of the associated mine or mineral
lease, if shorter. Estimates of residual values
and useful lives are reassessed annually and any
change in estimate is taken into account in the
determination of remaining depreciation charges.
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of
the lease term and their useful lives. Freehold land
is not depreciated.
The property, plant and equipment is depreciated
on a straight-line or units of production basis over
the respective estimated useful lives as follows:
• Buildings

30 to 50 years;

• Plant, machinery
and equipment

5 to 40 years;

• Electrolysers

4 to 15 years;

• Mining assets

units of productio
on proven and
probable reserves;

• Other (except for
exploration and
evaluation assets)

1 to 20 years.

(e)

Intangible assets

(i)
Goodwill
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, an interest in
a joint venture or an associate or an interest in
a joint arrangement that comprises a business,
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities of the acquired business (or interest
in a business) are recognised at their fair values
unless the fair values cannot be measured reliably.
Where the fair values of assumed contingent
liabilities cannot be measured reliably, no liability is
recognised but the contingent liability is disclosed in
the same manner as for other contingent liabilities.
Goodwill arises when the cost of acquisition
exceeds the fair value of the Group’s interest
in the net fair value of identifiable net assets
acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested
for impairment annually. For this purpose, goodwill
arising on a business combination is allocated to
the cash-generating units expected to benefit from
the acquisition and any impairment loss recognised
is not reversed even where circumstances indicate
a recovery in value.
When the fair value of the Group’s share of
identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the
cost of acquisition, the difference is recognised
immediately in the statement of income.
In respect of associates or joint ventures, the
carrying amount of goodwill is included in the
carrying amount of the interest in the associate
and joint venture and the investment as a whole is
tested for impairment whenever there is objective
evidence of impairment. Any impairment loss is
allocated to the carrying amount of the interest in
the associate and joint venture.
(ii) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with
the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical
knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the
statement of income when incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design
for the production of new or substantially
improved products and processes. Development
expenditure is capitalised only if development
costs can be measured reliably, the product or
process is technically and commercially feasible,
future economic benefits are probable and the
Group intends to and has sufficient resources
to complete development and to use or sell the
asset. The expenditure capitalised includes the
cost of materials, direct labour and overhead
costs that are directly attributable to preparing

the asset for its intended use and capitalised
borrowing costs. Other development expenditure
is recognised in the statement of income when
incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses (refer to note 3(h)
(ii)).
(iii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the
Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured
at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses (refer to note 3(h)
(ii)).
(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it
increases the future economic benefits embodied
in the specific asset to which it relates. All other
expenditure, including expenditure on internally
generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in the
statement of income when incurred.
(v) Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in the statement of
income on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of intangible assets, other than
goodwill, from the date that they are available for
use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• software

5 years;

• contracts, acquired in
business combinations

2-8 years.

The amortisation method, useful lives and residual
values are reviewed at each financial year end and
adjusted if appropriate.
(f)
Leased assets
Leases under the terms of which the Group
assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon
initial recognition the leased asset is measured at
an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and
the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is
accounted for in accordance with the accounting
policy applicable to that asset.
The corresponding finance lease obligation is
included within interest bearing liabilities. The
interest element is allocated to accounting periods
during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of
interest on the remaining balance of the obligation
for each accounting period.

Assets held under other leases (operating leases)
are not recognised in the statement of financial
position. Payments made under the lease are
charged to the statement of income in equal
instalments over the accounting periods covered by
the lease term, except where an alternative basis is
more representative of the pattern of benefits to be
derived from the leased assets. Lease incentives
received are recognised in the statement of income
as an integral part of the aggregate net lease
payments made. Contingent rentals are charged to
the statement of income in the accounting period
in which they are incurred.

decline in its fair value below its cost is objective
evidence of impairment.

(g) Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or
net realisable value. Net realisable value is the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of
business, less the estimated costs of completion
and selling expenses.

All impairment losses are recognised in the
statement of income.

The cost of inventories is determined under the
weighted average cost method, and includes
expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories,
production or conversion costs and other costs
incurred in bringing them to their existing location
and condition. In the case of manufactured
inventories and work in progress, cost includes an
appropriate share of production overheads based
on normal operating capacity.
The production costs include mining and
concentrating costs, smelting, treatment and
refining costs, other cash costs and depreciation
and amortisation of operating assets.
(h)

Impairment

(i)
Financial assets
A financial asset not carried at fair value through
profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to
determine whether there is any objective evidence
that it is impaired. A financial asset is considered to
be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one
or more events have had a negative effect on the
estimated future cash flows of that asset occurred
after the initial recognition of that asset and the
impact can be estimated reliably.
Objective evidence that financial assets (including
equity securities) are impaired can include default
or delinquency by a debtor, restructuring of
an amount due to the Group on terms that the
Group would not consider otherwise, indications
that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy
and the disappearance of an active market for
a security. In addition, for an investment in
an equity security, a significant or prolonged

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset
measured at amortised cost is calculated as the
difference between its carrying amount and the
present value of the estimated future cash flows
discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Individually significant financial assets are tested for
impairment on an individual basis. The remaining
financial assets are assessed collectively in groups
that share similar credit risk characteristics.

An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can
be related objectively to an event occurring after
the impairment loss was recognised. For financial
assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is
recognised in the statement of income.
Impairment losses for trade receivables included
within trade and other receivables whose
recovery is considered doubtful but not remote
are recorded using an allowance account. When
the Group is satisfied that recovery is remote, the
amount considered irrecoverable is written off
against trade receivables directly and any amounts
held in the allowance account relating to that
receivable are reversed. Subsequent recoveries
of amounts previously charged to the allowance
account are reversed against the allowance
account. Other changes in the allowance account
and subsequent recoveries of amounts previously
written off directly are recognised in the statement
of income.
(ii) Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial
assets, other than inventories and deferred tax
assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to
determine whether there is any indication of
impairment. If any such indication exists then
the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets that are not
yet available for use, the recoverable amount is
estimated at each reporting date.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying
amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit
exceeds its recoverable amount. A cash-generating
unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that
generates cash flows that are largely independent
from other asset groups. Impairment losses are
recognised in the statement of income. Impairment
losses recognised in respect of cash-generating

units are allocated first to reduce the carrying
amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and
then to reduce the carrying amount of the other
assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata
basis.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is the greater of its value in use and
its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time
value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not
reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment
losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at
each reporting date for any indications that the loss
has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment
loss is reversed if there has been a change in
the estimates used to determine the recoverable
amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if
no impairment loss had been recognised.
Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount
of an investment in an associate or a joint venture
is not recognised separately and, therefore, is not
tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire
amount of the investment is tested for impairment
as a single asset when there is objective evidence
that the investment in an associate or a joint
venture may be impaired.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment
in an associate or joint venture is calculated as
the difference between its carrying amount after
application of the equity method of accounting
(refer to note 3(a) (iv)) and its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of such investment is the
greater of its value in use and its fair value less
cost to sell. In determining the value in use of the
investment the Group estimates: (a) its share of
the present value of the estimated future cash
flows expected to be generated by the investee,
including the cash flows from the operations of
the investee and the proceeds on the ultimate
disposal of the investment; or (b) the present value
of the estimated future cash flows expected to
arise from the dividends to be received from the
investee and from its ultimate disposal depending
on which available information with respect to each
investee is more reliable. An impairment loss is
reversed to the extent that the recoverable amount
of the investment subsequently increases and the
resulting carrying amount does not exceed the

carrying amount that would have been determined,
after application of the equity method, had no
impairment loss previously been recognised.
(i)
Insurance contracts
Where the Group enters into financial guarantee
contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other
companies, controlled by the beneficial shareholder
of the Group, the Group considers these to be
insurance arrangements and accounts for them
as such. In this respect, the Group treats the
guarantee contract as a contingent liability until
such time as it becomes probable that the Group
will be required to make a payment under the
guarantee.
(j)

Employee benefits

(i)

Salaries, annual bonuses, paid annual
leave and cost of non-monetary
benefits
Salaries, annual bonuses, paid annual leave and
cost of non-monetary benefits are accrued in the
year in which the associated services are rendered
by employees. Where payment or settlement is
deferred and the effect would be material, these
amounts are stated at their present values.
(ii)

Defined benefit pension and other
post-retirement plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined
benefit pension and other post-retirement plans is
calculated separately for each plan by estimating
the amount of future benefit that employees have
earned in return for their service in the current
and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to
determine its present value and any unrecognised
past service costs and the fair value of any plan
assets are deducted. The discount rate is the yield
at the reporting date on government bonds that
have maturity dates approximating the terms of the
Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed
using the projected unit credit method. When the
calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the
recognised asset is limited to the net total of any
unrecognised past service costs and the present
value of any future refunds from the plan or
reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Where there is a change in actuarial assumptions,
the resulting actuarial gains and losses are
recognised directly in the statement of
comprehensive income.
When the benefits of a plan are improved,
the portion of the increased benefit relating
to past service by employees is recognised
in the statement of income on a straight-line

basis over the average period until the benefits
become vested. To the extent that the benefits
vest immediately, the expense is recognised
immediately.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the
curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit
plan when the curtailment or settlement occurs.
The gain or loss on curtailment comprises any
resulting change in the fair value of plan assets, any
change in the present value of the defined benefit
obligation, any related actuarial gains and losses
and past service costs that had not previously been
recognised.
(iii) State pension fund
The Group makes contributions for the benefit of
employees to Russia’s and the Ukrainian State’s
pension funds. The contributions are expensed as
incurred.
(k) Provisions
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past
event, the Group has a present legal or constructive
obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are
determined by discounting the expected future
cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding
of the discount is recognised as finance costs.
(i)
Site restoration
The mining, refining and smelting activities of the
Group can give rise to obligations for site restoration
and rehabilitation. Restoration and rehabilitation
works can include facility decommissioning
and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste
materials, land rehabilitation, and site restoration.
The extent of work required and the associated
costs are dependent on the requirements of law
and the interpretations of the relevant authorities.
Provisions for the cost of each restoration and
rehabilitation program are recognised at the time
that environmental disturbance occurs. When the
extent of disturbance increases over the life of an
operation, the provision is increased accordingly.
Costs included in the provision encompass
obligated and reasonably estimable restoration
and rehabilitation activities expected to occur
progressively over the life of the operation and at
the time of closure in connection with disturbances
at the reporting date. Routine operating costs
that may impact the ultimate restoration and
rehabilitation activities, such as waste material
handling conducted as an integral part of a

mining or production process, are not included
in the provision. Costs arising from unforeseen
circumstances, such as the contamination caused
by unplanned discharges, are recognised as an
expense and liability when the event gives rise
to an obligation which is probable and capable of
reliable estimation.
Restoration and rehabilitation provisions are
measured at the expected value of future cash
flows, discounted to their present value and
determined according to the probability of
alternative estimates of cash flows occurring
for each operation. Discount rates used are
specific to the country in which the operation is
located. Significant judgements and estimates
are involved in forming expectations of future
activities and the amount and timing of the
associated cash flows. Those expectations are
formed based on existing environmental and
regulatory requirements.
When provisions for restoration and rehabilitation
are initially recognised, the corresponding cost is
capitalised as an asset, representing part of the
cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of
the operation. The capitalised cost of restoration
and rehabilitation activities is amortised over
the estimated economic life of the operation on
a units of production or straight-line basis. The
value of the provision is progressively increased
over time as the effect of discounting unwinds,
creating an expense recognised as part of finance
expenses.
Restoration and rehabilitation provisions are
also adjusted for changes in estimates. Those
adjustments are accounted for as a change in
the corresponding capitalised cost, except where
a reduction in the provision is greater than the
unamortised capitalised cost, in which case the
capitalised cost is reduced to nil and the remaining
adjustment is recognised in the statement of
income. Changes to the capitalised cost result
in an adjustment to future amortisation charges.
Adjustments to the estimated amount and timing
of future restoration and rehabilitation cash flows
are a normal occurrence in light of the significant
judgements and estimates involved. Factors
influencing those changes include revisions
to estimated reserves, resources and lives of
operations; developments in technology; regulatory
requirements and environmental management
strategies; changes in the estimated costs of
anticipated activities, including the effects of
inflation and movements in foreign exchange rates;
and movements in general interest rates affecting
the discount rate applied.

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

(l)

Revenue

Goods sold
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership
have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the
consideration is probable, the associated costs and
possible return of goods can be estimated reliably,
there is no continuing management involvement
with the good and the amount of revenue can
be measured reliably. This is generally when title
passes. If it is probable that discounts will be
granted and the amount can be measured reliably,
then the discount is recognised as a reduction of
revenue as the sales are recognised.
For the majority of sales transactions agreements
specify that title passes on the bill of lading date,
which is the date the commodity is delivered to the
shipping agent.
Revenue is not reduced for royalties or other taxes
payable from production.
(m) Other expenses
Social expenditure
To the extent that the Group’s contributions to
social programs benefit the community at large
and are not restricted to the Group’s employees,
they are recognised in the statement of income as
incurred.
(n) Finance income and expenses
Finance income comprises interest income
on funds invested, changes in the fair value of
financial assets at fair value through profit or
loss and foreign currency gains. Interest income
is recognised as it accrues, using the effective
interest method.
Finance expenses comprise interest expense
on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on
provisions, foreign currency losses and changes in
the fair value of financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss. All borrowing costs are recognised
in the statement of income using the effective
interest method, except for borrowing costs related
to the acquisition, construction and production of
qualifying assets which are recognised as part of
the cost of such assets.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a
net basis.
(o) Income tax expense
Income tax expense comprises current and
deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in
the statement of income and other comprehensive
income except to the extent that it relates to
items recognised directly in equity, in which case
it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the
taxable income for the year, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting
date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect
of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of
temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for
taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised
for the following temporary differences: the initial
recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of
assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a
business combination and that affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit, and differences
relating to investments in subsidiaries to the
extent that they probably will not reverse in
the foreseeable future. New information may
become available that causes the Company to
change its judgement regarding the adequacy
of existing tax liability. Such changes to tax
liabilities will impact tax expenses in the period
that such a determination is made. Deferred tax
is measured at the tax rates that are expected
to be applied to the temporary differences when
they reverse, based on the laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting
date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset
when they relate to income taxes levied by the
same taxation authority and the Group has both
the right and the intention to settle its current
tax assets and liabilities on a net or simultaneous
basis.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent
that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which temporary differences can
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at
each reporting date and are reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that the related tax
benefit will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the
distribution of dividends are recognised at the
same time as the liability to pay the related
dividends is recognised.

Financial Statements

(ii) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when
the Group has approved a detailed and formal
restructuring plan, and the restructuring either
has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.

(p)

Non-current assets held for sale and
discontinued operations
Non-current assets (or disposal groups
comprising assets and liabilities), that are
expected to be recovered primarily through sale
rather than through continuing use, are classified
as held for sale. Immediately before classification
as held for sale, the measurement of the assets
(and all assets and liabilities in a disposal group) is
brought up-to-date in accordance with applicable
IFRSs. Then, on initial classification as held for
sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are
recognised at the lower of carrying amount and
fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss
on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill,
and then to remaining assets and liabilities on
pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to
inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets
and employee benefit assets, which continue
to be measured in accordance with the Group’s
accounting policies.

(r)
(a)

(b)

Related parties
A person, or a close member of that person’s
family, is related to the Group if that person:
(i)

has control or joint control over the
Group;

(ii)

has significant influence over the
Group; or

(iii)

is a member of the key management
personnel of the Group or the Group’s
parent.

An entity is related to the Group if any of the
following conditions applies:
(i)

The entity and the Group are members
of the same group (which means that
each parent, subsidiary and fellow
subsidiary is related to the others).

A discontinued operation is a component of the
Group’s business that represents a separate major
line of business or geographical area of operations
or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view
to resale.

(ii)

One entity is an associate or joint
venture of the other entity (or an
associate or joint venture of a member
of a group of which the other entity is a
member).

Classification as a discontinued operation occurs
upon disposal or when the operation meets the
criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier. A
disposal group that has been abandoned may also
qualify.

(iii)

Both entities are joint ventures of the
same third party.

(iv)

One entity is a joint venture of a
third entity and the other entity is an
associate of the third entity.

(v)

The entity is a post-employment benefit
plan for the benefit of employees of
either the Group or an entity related to
the Group.

(vi)

The entity is controlled or jointly
controlled by a person identified in (a).

(vii)

A person identified in (a) (i) has
significant influence over the entity or
is a member of the key management
personnel of the entity (or of a parent
of the entity).

(q) Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group
that engages in business activities from which it
may earn revenue and incur expenses, including
revenue and expenses that relate to transactions
with any of the Group’s other components. All
operating segments’ operating results are reviewed
regularly by the Group’s CEO to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment
and assess its performance and for which discrete
consolidated financial information or statements are
available.
Individually material operating segments are not
aggregated for financial reporting purposes unless
the segments have similar economic characteristics
and are similar in respect of the nature of products
and services, the nature of production processes,
the type or class of customers, the methods used
to distribute the products or provide the services
and the nature of the regulatory environment.
Operating segments which are not individually
material may be aggregated if they share a majority
of these criteria.

(viii) The entity, or any member of a group
of which it is a part, provides key
management personnel services to the
group or to the group’s parent.
Close members of the family of a person are
those family members who may be expected to
influence, or be influenced by, that person in their
dealings with the entity.

4 Segment reporting
(a) Reportable segments
The Group has four reportable segments, as
described below, which are the Group’s strategic
business units. These business units are managed
separately and the results of their operations are
reviewed by the CEO on a regular basis.

Aluminium . The Aluminium segment is involved in
the production and sale of primary aluminium and
related products.
Alumina . The Alumina segment is involved in the
mining and refining of bauxite into alumina and the
sale of alumina.
Energy . The Energy segment includes the Group
companies and projects engaged in the mining and
sale of coal and the generation and transmission of
electricity produced from various sources. Where
the generating facility is solely a part of an alumina
or aluminium production facility it is included in the
respective reportable segment.
Mining and Metals . The Mining and Metals
segment includes the equity investment in PJSC
MMC Norilsk Nickel (“Norilsk Nickel”).
Other operations include manufacturing of semifinished products from primary aluminium for the
transportation, packaging, building and construction,
consumer goods and technology industries;
and the activities of the Group’s administrative
centres. None of these segments meet any of the
quantitative thresholds for determining reportable
segments in 2015 and 2014.
The Aluminium and Alumina segments are
vertically integrated whereby the Alumina segment
supplies alumina to the Aluminium segment for
further refining and smelting with limited sales of
alumina outside the Group. Integration between
the Aluminium, Alumina and Energy segments also
includes shared servicing and distribution.
(b) Segment results, assets and liabilities
For the purposes of assessing segment
performance and allocating resources between
segments, the Group’s senior executive
management monitor the results, assets and
liabilities attributable to each reportable segment on
the following bases:

Segment assets include all tangible, intangible
assets and current assets with the exception
of income tax assets and corporate assets.
Segment liabilities include trade and other payables
attributable to the production and sales activities
of the individual segments. Loans and borrowings
are not allocated to individual segments as they are
centrally managed by the head office.
Revenue and expenses are allocated to the reportable
segments with reference to sales generated by
those segments and the expenses incurred by
those segments or which otherwise arise from the
depreciation or amortisation of assets attributable to
those segments excluding impairment.
The measure used for reporting segment results
is the statement of income before income tax
adjusted for items not specifically attributed to
individual segments, such as finance income, costs
of loans and borrowings and other head office or
corporate administration costs. The segment profit
or loss is included in the internal management
reports that are reviewed by the Group’s CEO.
Segment profit or loss is used to measure
performance as management believes that such
information is the most relevant in evaluating the
results of certain segments relative to other entities
that operate within these industries.
In addition to receiving segment information
concerning segment results, management is
provided with segment information concerning
revenue (including inter-segment revenue),
the carrying value of investments and share of
profits/(losses) of associates and joint ventures,
depreciation, amortisation, impairment and
additions of non-current segment assets used by
the segments in their operations. Inter-segment
pricing is determined on a consistent basis using
market benchmarks.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred
during the year to acquire property, plant and
equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill.
The Group’s customer base includes only one
customer with whom transactions have exceeded
10% of the Group’s revenues. In 2015 revenues from
sales of primary aluminium and alloys to this customer
amounted to USD2,710 million (2014: USD2,745
million). Details of concentrations of credit risk arising
from this customer are set out in note 27(e).

(iii) Geographic information
The Group’s operating segments are managed on
a worldwide basis, but operate in four principal
geographical areas: the CIS, Europe, Africa and the

Americas. In the CIS, production facilities operate in
Russia and Ukraine. In Europe, production facilities
are located in Italy, Ireland and Sweden. African
production facilities are represented by bauxite

mines and an alumina refinery in Guinea and an
aluminium plant in Nigeria. In the Americas the
Group operates two production facilities in Jamaica,
one in Guyana and a trading subsidiary in the United
States of America.
The following table sets out information about the
geographical location of (i) the Group’s revenue
from external customers and (ii) the Group’s
property, plant and equipment, intangible assets

and interests in associates and joint ventures
(“specified non-current assets”). The geographical
location of customers is based on the location at
which the services were provided or the goods
were delivered. The geographical location of
the specified non-current assets is based on
the physical location of the asset. Unallocated
specified non-current assets comprise mainly
goodwill and interests in associates and joint
ventures.

subsidiaries domiciled in Switzerland the applicable
tax rate for the period is the corporate income tax
rate in the Canton of Zug, Switzerland, which may

vary depending on the subsidiary’s tax status. The
rate consists of a federal income tax and cantonal/
communal income and capital taxes. The latter
includes a base rate and a multiplier, which may
change from year to year. Applicable income tax
rates for 2015 are 9.27% and 14.60% for different
subsidiaries. For the Group’s significant trading
companies, the applicable tax rate is 0%. The
applicable tax rates for the year ended 31 December
2015 were the same as for the year ended 31
December 2014 except for Italy which was at 31.4%
for the year ended 31 December 2014.

Net book value

Depreciation expense of USD421million (2014:
USD421 million) has been charged to cost of
goods sold, USD5 million (2014: USD6 million) to
distribution expenses and USD17 million (2014:
USD18 million) to administrative expenses.

Based on results of impairment testing for the year
2015 and 2014, management has concluded that
no impairment loss relating to property, plant and
equipment should be recognised in these financial
statements.

During the years ended 31 December 2015 and
2014, no interest cost was capitalised due to
postponement of construction projects as a result
of the economic environment.

The recoverable amount of a number of the
cash generating units tested for impairment
are particularly sensitive to changes in forecast
aluminium prices, foreign exchange rates and
applicable discount rates.

Included into construction in progress at 31
December 2015 and 2014 are advances to suppliers
of property, plant and equipment of USD41 million
and USD20 million, respectively.
(a) Impairment
Management reviewed the carrying amount of the
group’s non-financial assets at the reporting date
to determine whether there were any indicators of
impairment. Management identified several factors
including declining aluminium prices and plant
closures in the industry that indicated that a number
of the Group’s cash-generating units may be impaired.
For the purposes of impairment testing the
recoverable amount of each cash generating unit
was determined by discounting expected future net
cash flows of the cash generating unit.

Additionally, management identified specific
items of property, plant and equipment that
are no longer in use and therefore are not
considered to be recoverable amounting to
USD115 million at 31 December 2015 (2014:
USD96 million). These assets have been
impaired in full. No further impairment of
property, plant and equipment or reversal of
previously recorded impairment was identified
by management.
(b) Security
The carrying value of property, plant and
equipment subject to lien under loan agreements
was USD612 million as at 31 December 2015 (31
December 2014: USD600 million), refer to note
22.

(a) Amortisation charge
The amortisation charge is included in cost of
sales in the consolidated statement of income.
(b) Goodwill
Goodwill recognised in these consolidated
financial statements initially arose on the
formation of the Group in 2000 and the
acquisition of a 25% additional interest in the
Group by its controlling shareholder in 2003. The
amount of goodwill was principally increased
in 2007 as a result of the acquisition of certain
businesses of SUAL Partners and Glencore.

(c)

Impairment testing of goodwill and
other intangible assets
For the purposes of impairment testing, the
entire amount of goodwill is allocated to the
aluminium segment of the Group’s operations.
The aluminium segment represents the lowest
level within the Group at which the goodwill is
monitored for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount represents value in
use as determined by discounting the future
cash flows generated from the continuing use
of the plants within the Group’s aluminium
segment.

At 31 December 2015, management analysed
changes in the economic environment and
developments in the aluminium industry and the
Group’s operations since 31 December 2014 and
performed an impairment test for goodwill at 31
December 2015 using the following assumptions to
determine the recoverable amount of the segment:
• Total production was estimated based on
average sustainable production levels of 3.7
million metric tonnes of primary aluminium,
of 7.5 million metric tonnes of alumina and of
12.0 million metric tonnes of bauxite. Bauxite
and alumina will be used primarily internally
for production of primary aluminium;
• Sales prices were based on the longterm aluminium price outlook derived from
available industry and market sources at
USD1,561 per tonne for primary aluminium
in 2016, USD1,710 in 2017, USD1,787 in
2018, USD1,853 in 2019, USD1,984 in 2020.
Operating costs were projected based on the
historical performance adjusted for inflation;
• Nominal foreign currency exchange rates
applied to convert operating costs of the
Group denominated in RUB into USD were
RUB63.3 for one USD in 2016, RUB63.1 in
2017, RUB62.5 in 2018, RUB64.8 in 2019,
RUB67.5 in 2020. Inflation of 5.3% – 7.4% in
RUB and 1.6% - 2.4% in USD was assumed
in determining recoverable amounts;

production would have resulted in a 25%
decrease in the recoverable amount and
would not lead to an impairment;
• A 1% increase in the discount rate would
have resulted in a 13% decrease in the
recoverable amount and would not lead to
an impairment.
Based on results of impairment testing,
management concluded that no impairment
should be recorded in the consolidated financial
statements as at 31 December 2015.
At 31 December 2014, management analysed
changes in the economic environment and
developments in the aluminium industry and the
Group’s operations since 31 December 2013 and
performed an impairment test for goodwill at 31
December 2014 using the following assumptions
to determine the recoverable amount of the
segment:
• Total production was estimated based
on average sustainable production levels
of 3.6 million metric tonnes of primary
aluminium, of 7.4 million metric tonnes of
alumina and of 12.4 million metric tonnes of
bauxite. Bauxite and alumina will be used
primarily internally for production of primary
aluminium;

• A terminal value was derived following the
forecast period assuming a 2.0% annual
growth rate.

• Sales prices were based on the long-term
aluminium price outlook derived from
available industry and market sources at
USD2,010 per tonne for primary aluminium
in 2015, USD2,127 in 2016, USD2,203 in
2017, USD2,270 in 2018, USD2,313 in 2019.
Operating costs were projected based on
the historical performance adjusted for
inflation;

Values assigned to key assumptions and estimates
used to measure the units’ recoverable amount
was based on external sources of information and
historic data. Management believes that the values
assigned to the key assumptions and estimates
represented the most realistic assessment of future
trends. The results were particularly sensitive to
the following key assumptions:

• Nominal foreign currency exchange rates
applied to convert operating costs of the
Group denominated in RUB into USD were
RUB59.6 for one USD in 2015, RUB55.6 in
2016, RUB53.2 in 2017, RUB51.2 in 2018,
RUB49.3 in 2019. Inflation of 4.9% – 11.8% in
RUB and 1.5% - 2.5% in USD was assumed
in determining recoverable amounts;

• A 5% reduction in the projected aluminium
price level would have resulted in a decrease
in the recoverable amount by 29% and would
not lead to an impairment;

• The pre-tax discount rate was estimated
in nominal terms based on the weighted
average cost of capital basis and was 16.2%;

• The pre-tax discount rate was estimated
in nominal terms based on the weighted
average cost of capital basis and was 15.9%;

• A 5% increase in the projected level of
electricity and alumina costs in the aluminium

• A terminal value was derived following the
forecast period assuming a 2.1% annual
growth rate.

Values assigned to key assumptions and
estimates used to measure the units’ recoverable
amount was based on external sources of
information and historic data. Management
believes that the values assigned to the key
assumptions and estimates represented the most
realistic assessment of future trends. The results
were particularly sensitive to the following key
assumptions:
• A 5% reduction in the projected aluminium
price level would have resulted in a decrease
in the recoverable amount by 17% and would
not lead to an impairment;

• A 5% increase in the projected level of
electricity and alumina costs in the aluminium
production would have resulted in a 5%
decrease in the recoverable amount and
would not lead to an impairment;
• A 1% increase in the discount rate would have
resulted in a 6% decrease in the recoverable
amount and would not lead to an impairment.
Based on results of impairment testing,
management concluded that no impairment
should be recorded in the consolidated financial
statements as at 31 December 2014.

(a) PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel
The Group’s investment in Norilsk Nickel is
accounted for using equity method and the
carrying value as at 31 December 2015 and 31
December 2014 amounted USD2,776 million and
USD4,141 million, respectively. The market value
amounted USD5,542 million and USD6,388 million
as at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014,
respectively, and is determined by multiplying
the quoted bid price per share on the Moscow
Exchange on the year-end date by the number of
shares held by the Group.
(b) Queensland Alumina Limited
The carrying value and market value of the Group’s
investment in Queensland Alumina Limited as at 31
December 2015 and 31 December 2014 amounted
USD nill and USD327 million, respectively.
The Group’s share of profits/(losses) in associate
for the year ended 31 December 2015 includes
impairment losses relating to investment in
Queensland Alumina Limited of which USD283
million was recognised by the Group.
The recoverable amount of investment in
Queensland Alumina Limited as at 31 December

100%

2015 was determined by discounting the expected
future net cash flows of the cash generating unit
and applying the share of Group’s ownership to the
resulting figure.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to discount the
cash flows was 11.0%, estimated in nominal terms
based on an industry weighted average cost of
capital.
The recoverable amount of the cash generating
unit is particularly sensitive to changes in forecast
alumina prices, foreign exchange rates, applicable
discount rate.
The Group recognised its share of impairment
losses in Queensland Alumina Limited to the
extent of its investment in the entity in the amount
of USD283 million and made the necessary
adjustment to the carrying value of the investment
which was written down to nil.
(c) BEMO project
The carrying value and market value of the Group’s
investment in BEMO project as at 31 December
2015 and 31 December 2014 amounted USD329
million and USD198 million, respectively.

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

For the purposes of impairment testing, the BEMO
project was separated into two cash generating
units – the Boguchansky Aluminium Smelter
(“BoAZ’) and the Boguchansky Hydro Power
Plant (“BoGES”). The recoverable amount was
determined by discounting the expected future net
cash flows of each cash generating unit.
The pre-tax discount rates applied to discount the cash
flows for BoAZ and BoGES were 16.5% and 18.9%,
respectively, estimated in nominal terms based on an
industry weighted average cost of capital.
The recoverable amounts of the two cash
generating units are particularly sensitive to
changes in forecast aluminium and electricity
prices, foreign exchange rates, applicable discount
rates and, in respect to BoAZ, the forecast period
to reach full production capacity.
The Group recognised its share of reversal of
impairment losses in BoGES and made the
necessary adjustment to the carrying value of
investment. The Group’s share of gains related to
BoGES was recognized in the amount of USD143
million.
As a result of impairment testing no further
impairment of investment in BoAZ project or
reversal of previously recorded impairment was
identified by management.
At 31 December 2015, losses of USD357 million
related to impairment charges at BoAZ have not

been recognised because the Group’s investment
has already been fully written down to nil.
At 31 December 2014, management analysed
changes in the economic environment and
developments in the aluminium and power
generation industries since 31 December 2013 and
performed an impairment test for its investment in
BEMO project at 31 December 2014.
The pre-tax discount rates applied to discount the
cash flows for BoAZ and BoGES were 17.2% and
21.5%, respectively, estimated in nominal terms
based on an industry weighted average cost of
capital.
The recoverable amounts of the two cash
generating units are particularly sensitive to
changes in forecast aluminium and electricity
prices, foreign exchange rates, applicable
discount rates and, in respect to BoAZ, the
expected timing of commencement of the project
and the forecast period to reach full production
capacity.
As a result of impairment testing, no further
impairment of investment in BEMO project or
reversal of previously recorded impairment was
identified by management.
At 31 December 2014, losses of USD375 million
related to impairment charges at BoAZ have not
been recognised because the Group’s investment
has already been fully written down to nil.
Summary of the additional financial information
of the Group’s effective interest in BEMO project
for the year ended 31 December 2015 and 31
December 2014 is presented below (all in USD
million):

Financial Statements

The Group’s share of profits/(losses) in joint ventures
for the year ended 31 December 2015 includes

Retained earnings of the Group’s subsidiaries
where dividend distributions are subject to taxation
included USD1,160 million and USD1,249 million
as at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014,
respectively, for which deferred taxation has
not been provided because remittance of the
earnings has been indefinitely postponed through
reinvestment and, as a result, such amounts are

considered to be permanently invested. It was not
practicable to determine the amount of temporary
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries
where the Group is able to control the timing of
reversal of the difference. Reversal is not expected
in the foreseeable future. For other subsidiaries
in the Group, including the significant trading
companies, the distribution of dividends does not
give rise to taxes.

All of the trade and other receivables are expected
to be settled or recognised as an expense within
one year or are repayable on demand.
The specific allowance for doubtful trade and other
receivables and the uncollectible amount of trade
and other receivables written off during the year
ended 31 December 2015 amounted USD8 million
and USD13 million, respectively (31 December 2014:
USD4 million and USD29 million, respectively).

Trade receivables in the amount of USD68 million
are pledged under existing secure loans from
related parties at 31 December 2015 (31 December
2014: USD67 million), refer to note 22.
(a) Ageing analysis
Included in trade and other receivables are trade
receivables (net of allowance for doubtful debts)
with the following ageing analysis as of the

Amounts past due

Trade receivables are on average due within 60
days from the date of billing. The receivables that
are neither past due nor impaired (i.e. current)
relate to a wide range of customers for whom there
was no recent history of default.
Receivables that were past due but not impaired
relate to a number of customers that have a

good track record with the Group. Based on past
experience, management believes that no impairment
allowance is necessary in respect of these balances
as there has not been a significant change in credit
quality and the balances are still considered fully
recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral
over these balances. Further details of the Group’s
credit policy are set out in note 27(e).

(b) Impairment of trade receivables
Impairment losses in respect of trade receivables
are recorded using an allowance account unless
the Group is satisfied that recovery of the amount
is remote, in which case the impairment loss is
written off against trade receivables directly.

The movement in the allowance for doubtful
debts during the year, including both specific and
collective loss components, is as follows:

Year ended 31 December

Balance at the beginning of the year
(Impairment loss recognised)/Impairment loss reversal
Uncollectible amounts written off
Balance at the end of the year

As at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014,
the Group’s trade receivables of USD25 million
and USD18 million, respectively, were individually
determined to be impaired. Management assessed
that the receivables were not expected to be

(a) Pension liabilities
Group subsidiaries in the Russian
Federation
The Group voluntarily provides long-term and postemployment benefits to its former and existing
employees including death-in-service, jubilee, lump
sum upon retirement, material support for pensioners
and death-in-pension benefits. Furthermore, the
Group provides regular social support payments to
some of its veterans of World War II.
The above employee benefit programs are of a
defined benefit nature. The Group finances these
programs on a pay-as-you-go basis, so plan assets
are equal to zero.

Group subsidiaries in Ukraine
Due to legal requirements, the Ukrainian
subsidiaries are responsible for partial financing
of the state hardship pensions for those of
its employees who worked, or still work,
under severe and hazardous labour conditions
(hardship early retirement pensions). These
pensions are paid until the recipient reaches
the age of entitlement to the State old age
pension (55-60 years for female (dependent on
year of birth) and 60 years for male employees).
In Ukraine, the Group also voluntarily provides
long-term and post-employment benefits to its
employees including death-in-service, lump sum
benefits upon retirement and death-in-pension
benefits.

The Group has wholly unfunded plans.
(b) Site restoration
The Group provides for site restoration obligations
when there is a specific legal or constructive
obligation for mine reclamation, landfill closure
(primarily comprising red mud basin disposal
sites) or specific lease restoration requirements.
The Group does not record any obligations with
respect to decommissioning of its refining or
smelting facilities and restoration and rehabilitation
of the surrounding areas unless there is a specific
plan to discontinue operations at a facility. This
is because any significant costs in connection

Timing of inflated cash outflows

Risk free discount rate after adjusting for inflation (a)

At each reporting date the Directors have assessed
the provisions for site restoration and environmental
matters and concluded that the provisions and
disclosures are adequate.
(a) the risk free rate for the year 2014-2015 represents an

effective rate, which comprises rates differentiated by years

with decommissioning of refining or smelting
facilities and restoration and rehabilitation of the
surrounding areas would be incurred no earlier
than when the facility is closed and the facilities
are currently expected to operate over a term in
excess of 50-100 years due to the perpetual nature
of the refineries and smelters and continuous
maintenance and upgrade programs resulting in the
fair values of any such liabilities being negligible.
The site restoration provision recorded in these
consolidated financial statements relates primarily
to mine reclamation and red mud basin disposal
sites at alumina refineries and is estimated by
discounting the risk-adjusted expected expenditure
to its present value based on the following key
assumptions:

were several claims filed against the Group’s
subsidiaries contesting breaches of contract
terms and non-payment of existing obligations.
Management has reviewed the circumstances
and estimated that the amount of probable
outflow related to these claims should not
exceed USD13 million (31 December 2014:
USD15 million). The amount of claims, where
management assesses outflow as possible
approximates USD37 million (31 December 2014:
USD111 million).
At each reporting date the Directors have
assessed the provisions for litigation and claims
and concluded that the provisions and disclosures
are adequate.

(d) Tax provisions
At each reporting date the Directors have
assessed the provisions for taxation and concluded
that the provisions and disclosures are adequate.
(e) Provision for guarantees
In September 2013 the Group entered into an
agreement with OJSC RusHydro to provide
funds to BoAZ, if the latter is unable to fulfil
its obligations under its credit facility with GK
Vnesheconombank. This agreement represents a
surety for the increased credit limit obtained for
the financing of BoAZ. The aggregate exposure
under the agreement is limited to RUB16.8 billion
(USD231 million) and is split between the Group
and OJSC RusHydro in equal proportion.

of entering into the credit facility to convert the
credit facility to USD with a 3M LIBOR + 5.05%
interest rate. On 17 December 2015 the option was
exercised by VTB Capital.

Management believes that the values assigned to
the key assumptions and estimates represented
the most realistic assessment of future trends. The
results for cross-currency swaps are particularly
sensitive to changes in RUB/USD exchange rate
forward curve. A 10% increase in RUB/USD
exchange rate would result in USD22 million of
additional loss. The results for other derivative
instruments are not particularly sensitive to any
factors.

Cross-currency swaps
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the
Group entered into cross-currency swaps to
transform the two tranches of its rouble bonds into
USD obligations of USD530 million and USD533
million, respectively (refer to note 23). The terms
of the swaps were 3 and 4 years, respectively. In
February 2012 – August 2013 the Group entered
into cross-currency swaps to convert RUB18.3
billion of 5 year rouble denominated credit facility
into a USD denominated liability of USD598
million.

Cross-currency option
On 16 December 2013 the Group entered into a
credit facility up to RUB15 billion with VTB Capital
Plc with a maturity of 5 years and an interest rate
of 3M Mosprime + 4.0% and drew down RUB10.1
billion (USD309 million) on 17 December 2013.
The credit facility includes an option which may
be exercised by the bank two years from the date

At 31 December 2014 the Group recognised a loss
on part of the instruments as they were considered
ineffective. The reasons for this were partial buyback of bonds in relation to the second tranche, and
change of maturity date for RUB18.3 billion facility
as a result of refinancing.

USD366.0 per tonne, respectively.
In May and September 2011, the Group entered
into long-term petroleum coke supply contracts
where the price of coke is determined with
reference to the LME aluminium price and the
Brent oil price. The strike price for aluminium is set
at USD2,403.45 per tonne and USD2,497.72 per
tonne, respectively, while the strike price for oil
is set at USD61.10 per barrel and USD111.89 per

27 Financial risk
management and
fair values

(a) Fair values
Management believes that the fair values of shortterm financial assets and liabilities approximate
their carrying amounts.
The methods used to estimate the fair values of
the financial instruments are as follows:
Trade and other receivables, cash and cash
equivalents, current loans and borrowings
and trade and other payables: the carrying
amounts approximate fair value because of the
short maturity period of the instruments.
Long-term loans and borrowings, other
non-current liabilities: the fair values of other
non-current liabilities are based on the present
value of the anticipated cash flows and approximate
carrying value, other than bonds issued.
Derivatives: the fair value of derivative financial
instruments, including embedded derivatives,
is based on quoted market prices. Where no
price information is available from a quoted
market source, alternative market mechanisms
or recent comparable transactions, fair value

Included in trade and other payables are trade
payables with the following ageing analysis as at
the reporting date.

is estimated based on the Group’s views on
relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances
to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other
risks implicit in such estimates. Option-based
derivatives are valued using Black-Scholes models
and Monte-Carlo simulations. The derivative
financial instruments are recorded at their fair
value at each reporting date.
The following table presents the fair value of
Group’s financial instruments measured at the
end of the reporting period on a recurring basis,
categorised into the three-level fair value hierarchy
as defined by IFRS 13, Fair value measurement .
The level into which a fair value measurement
is classified is determined with reference to the
observability and significance of the inputs used in
the valuation technique as follows:
• Level 1 valuations: Fair value measured using
only Level 1 inputs i.e. unadjusted quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities at the measurement date
• Level 2 valuations: Fair value measured using
Level 2 inputs i.e. observable inputs which
fail to meet Level 1, and not using significant
unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs are
inputs for which market data are not available
• Level 3 valuations: Fair value measured using
significant unobservable inputs

(b)

Financial risk management objectives
and policies
The Group’s principal financial instruments
comprise bank loans and trade payables. The main
purpose of these financial instruments is to raise
finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has
various financial assets such as trade receivables
and cash and short-term deposits, which arise
directly from its operations.

Group’s risk management policies and procedures
and reviews the adequacy of the risk management
framework in relation to the risks faced by the
Group. The Group’s Audit Committee is assisted
in its oversight role by the Group’s Internal Audit
function which undertakes both regular and ad
hoc reviews of risk management controls and
procedures, the results of which are reported to the
Audit Committee.

The main risks arising from the Group’s financial
instruments are cash flow interest rate risk,
liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit
risk. Management reviews and agrees policies
for managing each of these risks which are
summarised below.

(c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market
prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest
rates and equity prices will affect the Group’s
income or the value of its holdings of financial
instruments. The objective of market risk
management is to manage and control market risk
exposures within acceptable parameters, while
optimising returns.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for
the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk
management framework. The Board has established
a risk management group within its Department of
Internal Control, which is responsible for developing
and monitoring the Group’s risk management
policies. The Department reports regularly to the
Board of Directors on its activities.
The Group’s risk management policies are
established to identify and analyse the risks faced
by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and
controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to
limits. Risk management policies and systems are
reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market
conditions and the Group’s activities. The Group,
through its training and management standards
and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined
and constructive control environment in which all
employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how
management monitors compliance with the

(i)
Commodity price risk
During the years ended 31 December 2015 and
2014, the Group has entered into certain long
term electricity contracts and other commodity
derivatives contracts in order to manage its
exposure of commodity price risks. Details of the
contracts are disclosed in note 25.
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes
in market interest rates relates primarily to the
Group’s long-term debt obligations with floating
interest rates (refer to note 22). The Group’s policy
is to manage its interest costs by monitoring
changes in interest rates with respect to its
borrowings.
The following table details the interest rate
profile of the Group’s borrowings at the reporting
date.

(iii) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales,
purchases and borrowings that are denominated
in a currency other than the respective functional
currencies of group entities, primarily USD but also
the Russian Rouble, Ukrainian Hryvna and Euros.
The currencies in which these transactions primarily
are denominated are RUB, USD and EUR.
Borrowings are primarily denominated in currencies
that match the cash flows generated by the
underlying operations of the Group, primarily USD
but also RUB and EUR. This provides an economic
hedge.

In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures
that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level
by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates
when necessary to address short-term imbalances or
entering into currency swap arrangements.
The Group’s exposure at the reporting date to foreign
currency risk arising from recognised assets and liabilities
denominated in a currency other than the functional
currency of the entity to which they relate is set out in the
table below. Differences resulting from the translation
of the financial statements of foreign operations into the
Group’s presentation currency are ignored.

Results of the analysis as presented in the
above tables represent an aggregation of the
instantaneous effects on the Group entities’ profit
before taxation and other comprehensive income
measured in the respective functional currencies,
translated into USD at the exchange rates ruling at
the reporting date for presentation purposes.
The sensitivity analysis assumes that the change
in foreign exchange rates had been applied to remeasure those financial instruments held by the Group
which expose the Group to foreign currency risk at
the reporting date. The analysis excludes differences
that would result from the translation of other
financial statements of foreign operations into the
Group’s presentation currency. The analysis has been
performed on the same basis for all years presented.

(d) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be
able to meet its financial obligations as they fall
due. The group policy is to maintain sufficient cash
and cash equivalents or have available funding
through an adequate amount of committed
credit facilities to meet its operating and financial
commitments.
The following tables show the remaining contractual
maturities at the reporting date of the Group’s nonderivative financial liabilities, which are based on
contractual undiscounted cash flows (including
interest payment computed using contractual rates,
or if floating, based on rates current at the reporting
date) and the earliest the Group can be required to
pay.

Guarantees

(e) Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised,
creditworthy third parties. It is the Group’s policy
that all customers who wish to trade on credit
terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
The majority of the Group’s third party trade
receivables represent balances with the world’s
leading international corporations operating in the
metals industry. In addition, receivable balances
are monitored on an ongoing basis with the
result that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is
not significant. Goods are normally sold subject
to retention of title clauses, so that in the event
of non-payment the Group may have a secured
claim. The Group does not require collateral in
respect of trade and other receivables. The details
of impairment of trade and other receivables are
disclosed in note 19. The extent of the Group’s
credit exposure is represented by the aggregate
balance of financial assets and financial guarantees
given.
At 31 December 2015 and 2014, the Group has
certain concentrations of credit risk as 7.5% and
10.2% of the total trade receivables were due from
the Group’s largest customer and 8.9% and 13.0%
of the total trade receivables were due from the
Group’s five largest customers, respectively (refer
to note 5 for the disclosure on revenue from largest
customer).
With respect to credit risk arising from guarantees,
the Group’s policy is to provide financial
guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries,
associates and joint ventures. Management have

recognised a provision of USD100 million against
the Group’s exposure to guarantees (refer to note
24(e)).
(f)
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital
are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern in order to provide returns for
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders
and to maintain an optimal capital structure to
reduce the cost of capital.
The Group manages its capital structure and
makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in
economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the
capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount
of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to
reduce debt.
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital
base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market
confidence and to sustain future development of
the business. The Board of Directors monitors the
return on capital, which the Group defines as net
operating income divided by total shareholders’
equity, excluding non-controlling interests. The
Board of Directors also monitors the level of
dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between
higher returns that might be possible with
higher levels of borrowings and the advantages
and security afforded by a sound capital
position.

There were no changes in the Group’s approach to
capital management during the year.

on the actual purchase volumes and applicable
prices.

The Company and its subsidiaries were subject to
externally imposed capital requirements in the both
years presented in these consolidated financial
statements.

Commitments with related parties – companies
under common control for purchases of alumina in
2016-2017 under supply agreements are estimated
at USD110 million at 31 December 2015 (31
December 2014: USD262 million). Commitments
with a related party - joint venture for purchases of
primary aluminium and alloys in 2016-2030 under
supply agreements are estimated from USD5,512
million to USD6,838 million (31 December 2014:
nil) depending on the actual purchase volumes and
applicable prices.

(g) Master netting or similar agreements
The Group may enter into sales and purchase
agreements with the same counterparty in the
normal course of business. The related amount
receivable and payable do not always meet the
criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial
position. This is because the Group may not have
any currently legally enforceable right to offset
recognised amounts, because the right to offset
may be enforceable only on the occurrence of
future events.
There are no financial instruments that meet the
offsetting criteria in the statement of financial
position for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Amount of USD21 million related to recognised
financial instruments that do not meet some
or all of the offsetting criteria is included within
financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at
31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: USD35
million).

28 Commitments

(a) Capital commitments
The Group has entered into contracts that result
in contractual obligations primarily relating to
various construction and capital repair works.
The commitments at 31 December 2015 and 31
December 2014 approximated USD169 million and
USD319 million, respectively. These commitments
are due over a number of years.
(b) Purchase commitments
Commitments with third parties for purchases of
alumina, bauxite, other raw materials and other
purchases in 2016-2034 under supply agreements
are estimated from USD3,793 million to USD4,912
million at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014:
USD3,400 million to USD3,962 million) depending

(c) Sale commitments
Commitments with third parties for sales of
alumina and other raw materials in 2016-2034
are estimated from USD793 million to USD1,349
million at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014:
from USD958 million to USD1,946 million) and will
be settled at market prices at the date of delivery.
Commitments with related parties for sales of
alumina in 2016-2019 approximated from USD504
million to USD1,046 million at 31 December 2015
(31 December 2014: from USD852 million to
USD1,324 million).
Commitments with related parties for sales
of primary aluminium and alloys in 2016-2030
are estimated to range from USD4,441 million
to USD5,016 million at 31 December 2015 (31
December 2014: from USD5,780 million to
USD6,690 million). Commitments with third parties
for sales of primary aluminium and alloys at 31
December 2015 are estimated to range from
USD307 million to USD654 million (31 December
2014: from USD923 million to USD1,144 million).
These commitments will be settled at market
price at the date of delivery. Commitments include
sales to Glencore in accordance with a long-term
contract for which the sales volumes will depend
on the actual production in 2016-2017. The volume
of sales commitments to Glencore for 2016 year
under the agreement is specified and is estimated
to be from USD2,179 to USD2,268 million.
(d) Operating lease commitments
Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable
as follows:

(e) Social commitments
The Group contributes to the maintenance and
upkeep of the local infrastructure and the welfare
of its employees, including contributions toward
the development and maintenance of housing,
hospitals, transport services, recreation and
other social needs of the regions of the Russian
Federation where the Group’s production entities
are located. The funding of such assistance is
periodically determined by management and is
appropriately capitalised or expensed as incurred.

29 Contingencies

(a) Taxation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is
subject to varying interpretations, and changes,
which can occur frequently. Management’s
interpretation of such legislation as applied to the
transactions and activities of the Group may be
challenged by the relevant local, regional and federal
authorities. Notably recent developments in the
Russian environment suggest that the authorities
in this country are becoming more active in seeking
to enforce, through the Russian court system,
interpretations of the tax legislation, in particular
in relation to the use of certain commercial trading
structures, which may be selective for particular
tax payers and different to the authorities’
previous interpretations or practices. Different
and selective interpretations of tax regulations by
various government authorities and inconsistent
enforcement create further uncertainties in the
taxation environment in the Russian Federation.
Tax declarations, together with related
documentation, are subject to review and
investigation by a number of authorities, each of
which may impose fines, penalties and interest
charges. Fiscal periods remain open to review by
the authorities for three calendar years preceding
the year of review. Under certain circumstances
reviews may cover longer periods. In addition, in
some instances, new tax regulations effectively
have been given retroactive effect. Additional

taxes, penalties and interest which may be material
to the financial position of the taxpayers may be
assessed in the Russian Federation as a result of
such reviews.
In addition to the amounts of income tax the
Group has provided, there are certain tax positions
taken by the Group where it is reasonably possible
(though less than 50% likely) that additional tax
may be payable upon examination by the tax
authorities or in connection with ongoing disputes
with tax authorities. The Group’s best estimate
of the aggregate maximum of additional amounts
that it is reasonably possible may become payable
if these tax positions were not sustained at 31
December 2015 is USD237 million (31 December
2014: USD357 million).
The Group’s major trading companies are
incorporated in low tax jurisdictions outside Russia
and a significant portion of the Group’s profit is
realised by these companies. Management believes
that these trading companies are not subject to
taxes outside their countries of incorporation and
that the commercial terms of transactions between
them and other group companies are acceptable
to the relevant tax authorities. These consolidated
financial statements have been prepared on this
basis. However, as these companies are involved
in a significant level of cross border activities, there
is a risk that Russian or other tax authorities may
challenge the treatment of cross-border activities
and assess additional tax charges. It is not possible
to quantify the financial exposure resulting from
this risk.
New transfer pricing legislation enacted in the
Russian Federation starting from 1 January
2012 provides for major modifications making
local transfer pricing rules closer to OECD
guidelines, but creating additional uncertainty in
practical application of tax legislation in certain
circumstances.
The new transfer pricing rules introduce an
obligation for the taxpayers to prepare transfer
pricing documentation with respect to controlled

transactions and prescribe new basis and
mechanisms for accruing additional taxes and
interest in case prices in the controlled transactions
differ from the market level. The new transfer
pricing rules eliminated the 20-percent price safe
harbour that existed under the previous transfer
pricing rules applicable to transactions on or prior to
31 December 2011.
The new transfer pricing rules primarily apply to
cross-border transactions between related parties,
as well as to certain cross-border transactions
between independent parties, as determined
under the Russian Tax Code. In addition, the rules
apply to in-country transactions between related
parties if the accumulated annual volume of the
transactions between the same parties exceeds
a particular threshold (RUB3 billion in 2012, RUB2
billion in 2013, and RUB1 billion in 2014 and
thereon).
Since there is no practice of applying the new
transfer pricing rules by the tax authorities and
courts, it is difficult to predict the effect, if any, of
the new transfer pricing rules on these consolidated
financial statements.
The Company believes it is compliant with the new
rules as it has historically applied the OECD -based
transfer pricing principles. Estimating additional tax
which may become payable is inherently imprecise.
It is, therefore, possible that the amount ultimately
payable may exceed the Group’s best estimate
of the maximum reasonably possible liability;
however, the Group considers that the likelihood
that this will be the case is remote.
The new controlled foreign company (“CFC”)
rules have been introduced in Russia starting from
1 January 2015. The rules apply to undistributed
profits of non-Russian CFC controlled by Russian
tax-resident shareholders. The Company is taxresident in Cyprus and managed and controlled
from Cyprus and the new CFC rules shall not
directly apply to the Group in relation to any of its
non-Russian affiliates. The CFC rules may apply
to Russian tax-resident controlling shareholders
of the Company, where such shareholder controls
more than 50% of the Company (starting from
2016 more than 25% or 10% where all Russian
tax-resident shareholders together control more
than 50%). The rules also introduce certain
reporting requirements for such Russian taxresident controlling shareholders of the Company
starting from 2015 in relation to non-Russian
affiliates of the Group where such shareholders
directly or indirectly control more than 10% of
those affiliates.

(b) Environmental contingencies
The Group and its predecessor entities have
operated in the Russian Federation, Ukraine,
Jamaica, Guyana, the Republic of Guinea and
the European Union for many years and certain
environmental problems have developed.
Governmental authorities are continually
considering environmental regulations and their
enforcement and the Group periodically evaluates
its obligations related thereto. As obligations are
determined, they are recognised immediately.
The outcome of environmental liabilities under
proposed or any future legislation, or as a result of
stricter enforcement of existing legislation, cannot
reasonably be estimated. Under current levels of
enforcement of existing legislation, management
believes there are no possible liabilities, which
will have a material adverse effect on the financial
position or the operating results of the Group.
However, the Group anticipates undertaking
significant capital projects to improve its future
environmental performance and to bring it into full
compliance with current legislation.
(c) Legal contingencies
The Group’s business activities expose it to a
variety of lawsuits and claims which are monitored,
assessed and contested on the ongoing basis.
Where management believes that a lawsuit or
another claim would result in the outflow of the
economic benefits for the Group, a best estimate
of such outflow is included in provisions in the
consolidated financial statements (refer to note 24).
As at 31 December 2015 the amount of claims,
where management assesses outflow as possible
approximates USD37 million (31 December 2014:
USD111 million).
In January 2013, the Company received a writ of
summons and statement of claim filed in the High
Court of Justice of the Federal Capital Territory
of Nigeria (Abuja) by plaintiff BFIG Group Divino
Corporation (“BFIG”) against certain subsidiaries
of the Company. It is a claim for damages arising
out of the defendants’ alleged tortious interference
in the bid process for the sale of the Nigerian
government’s majority stake in the Aluminium
Smelter Company of Nigeria (“ALSCON”) and
alleged loss of BFIG’s earnings resulting from
its failed bid for the said stake in ALSCON. BFIG
seeks compensatory damages in the amount of
USD2.8 billion. In January 2014 the court granted
the Company’s motion to join the Federal Republic
of Nigeria and Attorney General of Nigeria to
the case as co-defendants. The next hearing is
currently scheduled for 22 March 2016. Based on a
preliminary assessment of the claim, the Company
does not expect the case to have any material

237

238

adverse effect on the Group’s financial position or
its operation as a whole.
(d) Risks and concentrations
A description of the Group’s major products and its
principal markets, as well as exposure to foreign
currency risks are provided in note 1 “Background”
and note 27 “Financial risk management and fair
values”. The price at which the Group can sell
its products is one of the primary drivers of the
Group’s revenue. The Group’s prices are largely
determined by prices set in the international
market. The Group’s future profitability and overall
performance is strongly affected by the price of
primary aluminium that is set in the international
market.
(e) Insurance
Where the Group enters into financial guarantee
contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other
companies, controlled by the beneficial shareholder

of the Group, the Group considers these to be
insurance arrangements and accounts for them
as such. In this respect, the Group treats the
guarantee contract as a contingent liability until
such time as it becomes probable that the Group
will be required to make a payment under the
guarantee.

(e) Pricing policies
Prices for transactions with related parties are
determined on a case by case basis but are not
necessarily at arm’s length.
The Group has entered into three categories of
related-party transactions: (i) those entered into
on an arm’s length basis, (ii) those entered into
on non-arm’s length terms but as part of a wider
deal resulting from arms’ length negotiations with
unrelated third parties, and (iii) transactions unique
to the Group and the counterparty.

34 Events subsequent

date

There were no significant events subsequent to the
reporting date.

35 Accounting
estimates and
judgements

The Group has identified the following critical
accounting policies under which significant
judgements, estimates and assumptions are
made and where actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions
and conditions and may materially affect financial
results or the financial position reported in future
periods.
Property, plant and equipment –
recoverable amount
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies,
each asset or cash generating unit is evaluated
every reporting period to determine whether there

are any indications of impairment. If any such
indication exists, a formal estimate of recoverable
amount is performed and an impairment loss
recognised to the extent that the carrying amount
exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable
amount of an asset or cash generating group of
assets is measured at the higher of fair value less
costs to sell and value in use.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would
be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s
length transaction between knowledgeable and
willing parties and is generally determined as the
present value of the estimated future cash flows
expected to arise from the continued use of the
asset, including any expansion prospects, and its
eventual disposal.
Value in use is also generally determined as the
present value of the estimated future cash flows,
but only those expected to arise from the continued
use of the asset in its present form and its eventual
disposal. Present values are determined using a
risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate appropriate to
the risks inherent in the asset. Future cash flow
estimates are based on expected production and
sales volumes, commodity prices (considering
current and historical prices, price trends and
related factors), reserves (refer to ‘Bauxite reserve
estimates’ below), operating costs, restoration and
rehabilitation costs and future capital expenditure.
This policy requires management to make these
estimates and assumptions which are subject to
risk and uncertainty; hence there is a possibility
that changes in circumstances will alter these
projections, which may impact the recoverable

243

Financial Statement

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

244

Driven by Green Power

amount of the assets. In such circumstances,
some or all of the carrying value of the assets may
be impaired and the impairment would be charged
against the statement of income.
Inventories – net realisable value
The Group recognises write-downs of inventories
based on an assessment of the net realisable
value of the inventories. A write-down is applied
to the inventories where events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the net realisable
value is less than cost. The determination of net
realisable value requires the use of judgement and
estimates. Where the expectation is different from
the original estimates, such difference will impact
the carrying value of the inventories and the writedown of inventories charged to the statement of
income in the periods in which such estimate has
been changed.
Goodwill – recoverable amount
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies,
goodwill is allocated to the Group’s Aluminium
segment as it represents the lowest level within
the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for
internal management purposes and is tested for
impairment annually by preparing a formal estimate
of the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount
is estimated as the value in use of the Aluminium
segment.
Similar considerations to those described above
in respect of assessing the recoverable amount of
property, plant and equipment apply to goodwill.
Investments in associates and joint
ventures – recoverable amount
In accordance with the Group’s accounting
policies, each investment in an associate or joint
venture is evaluated every reporting period to
determine whether there are any indications of
impairment after application of the equity method
of accounting. If any such indication exists, a formal
estimate of recoverable amount is performed
and an impairment loss recognised to the extent
that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount of an investment
in an associate or joint venture is measured at the
higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in
use.
Similar considerations to those described above
in respect of assessing the recoverable amount of
property, plant and equipment apply to investments
in associates or joint venture. In addition to the
considerations described above the Group may also
assess the estimated future cash flows expected
to arise from dividends to be received from the

investment, if such information is available and
considered reliable.
Legal proceedings
In the normal course of business the Group may be
involved in legal proceedings. Where management
considers that it is more likely than not that
proceedings will result in the Group compensating
third parties a provision is recognised for the best
estimate of the amount expected to be paid.
Where management considers that it is more
likely than not that proceedings will not result in
the Group compensating third parties or where, in
rare circumstances, it is not considered possible
to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of the
amount expected to be paid, no provision is made
for any potential liability under the litigation but
the circumstances and uncertainties involved are
disclosed as contingent liabilities. The assessment
of the likely outcome of legal proceedings and
the amount of any potential liability involves
significant judgement. As law and regulations in
many of the countries in which the Group operates
are continuing to evolve, particularly in the areas
of taxation, sub-soil rights and protection of the
environment, uncertainties regarding litigation and
regulation are greater than those typically found in
countries with more developed legal and regulatory
frameworks.
Provision for restoration and rehabilitation
The Group’s accounting policies require the
recognition of provisions for the restoration
and rehabilitation of each site when a legal
or constructive obligation exists to dismantle
the assets and restore the site. The provision
recognised represents management’s best
estimate of the present value of the future costs
required. Significant estimates and assumptions
are made in determining the amount of restoration
and rehabilitation provisions. Those estimates
and assumptions deal with uncertainties
such as: changes to the relevant legal and
regulatory framework; the magnitude of possible
contamination and the timing, extent and costs
of required restoration and rehabilitation activity.
These uncertainties may result in future actual
expenditure differing from the amounts currently
provided.
The provision recognised for each site is periodically
reviewed and updated based on the facts and
circumstances available at the time. Changes to
the estimated future costs for operating sites are
recognised in the statement of financial position
by adjusting both the restoration and rehabilitation
asset and provision. Such changes give rise to a
change in future depreciation and interest charges.

For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are
recognised immediately in the statement of income.
Taxation
The Group’s accounting policy for taxation requires
management’s judgement in assessing whether
deferred tax assets and certain deferred tax
liabilities are recognised in the statement of
financial position. Deferred tax assets, including
those arising from carried forward tax losses,
capital losses and temporary differences, are
recognised only where it is considered more
likely than not that they will be recovered, which
is dependent on the generation of sufficient future
taxable profits. Deferred tax liabilities arising from
temporary differences in investments, caused
principally by retained earnings held in foreign tax
jurisdictions, are recognised unless repatriation
of retained earnings can be controlled and is not
expected to occur in the foreseeable future.
Assumptions about the generation of future
taxable profits and repatriation of retained
earnings depend on management’s estimates of
future cash flows. These depend on estimates
of future production and sales volumes,
commodity prices, reserves, operating costs,
restoration and rehabilitation costs, capital
expenditure, dividends and other capital
management transactions. Assumptions are
also required about the application of income tax
legislation. These estimates and assumptions
are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence there
is a possibility that changes in circumstances
will alter expectations, which may impact the
amount of deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities recognised on the statement of financial
position and the amount of other tax losses and
temporary differences not yet recognised. In
such circumstances, some or all of the carrying
amount of recognised deferred tax assets and
liabilities may require adjustment, resulting in a
corresponding credit or charge to the statement
of income.
The Group generally provides for current tax based
on positions taken (or expected to be taken) in its
tax returns. Where it is more likely than not that
upon examination by the tax authorities of the
positions taken by the Group additional tax will be
payable, the Group provides for its best estimate
of the amount expected to be paid (including any
interest and/or penalties) as part of the tax charge.
Bauxite reserve estimates
Reserves are estimates of the amount of product
that can be economically and legally extracted
from the Group’s properties. In order to calculate

reserves, estimates and assumptions are required
about a range of geological, technical and economic
factors, including quantities, grades, production
techniques, recovery rates, production costs,
transport costs, commodity demand, commodity
prices and exchange rates.
The Group determines ore reserves under the
Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral
Resources and Ore Reserves September 1999,
known as the JORC Code. The JORC Code requires
the use of reasonable investment assumptions to
calculate reserves.
Estimating the quantity and/or grade of reserves
requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies or
fields to be determined by analysing geological data
such as drilling samples. This process may require
complex and difficult geological judgements and
calculations to interpret the data.
Since economic assumptions used to estimate
reserves change from period to period, and since
additional geological data is generated during the
course of operations, estimates of reserves may
change from period to period.
Changes in reported reserves may affect the
Group’s financial results and financial position in a
number of ways, including the following:
• Asset carrying values may be affected due to
changes in estimated future cash flows.
• Depletion charged in the statement of
income may change where such charges are
determined by the units of production basis,
or where the useful economic lives of assets
change.
• Decommissioning, site restoration and
environmental provisions may change
where changes in estimated reserves affect
expectations about the timing or cost of
these activities.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure
The Group’s accounting policy for exploration and
evaluation expenditure results in certain items of
expenditure being capitalised for an area of interest
where it is considered likely to be recoverable
by future exploitation or sale or where the
activities have not reached a stage which permits
a reasonable assessment of the existence of
reserves. This policy requires management to make
certain estimates and assumptions as to future
events and circumstances, in particular whether
an economically viable extraction operation can be

245

Financial Statement

UC RUSAL 2015 Annual Report

246

Driven by Green Power

established. Any such estimates and assumptions
may change as new information becomes available.
If, after having capitalised the expenditure under
the policy, a judgement is made that recovery of
the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised
amount will be written off to the statement of
income.
Development expenditure
Development activities commence after project
sanctioning by the appropriate level of management.
Judgement is applied by management in
determining when a project has reached a stage
at which economically recoverable reserves exist
such that development may be sanctioned. In
exercising this judgement, management is required
to make certain estimates and assumptions similar
to those described above for capitalised exploration
and evaluation expenditure. Any such estimates
and assumptions may change as new information
becomes available. If, after having commenced the
development activity, a judgement is made that
a development asset is impaired, the appropriate
amount will be written off to the statement of
income.
Defined benefit pension and other post
retirement schemes
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost
of benefits charged to the statement of income
includes current and past service costs, interest
costs on defined benefit obligations and the effect
of any curtailments or settlements, net of expected
returns on plan assets. An asset or liability is
consequently recognised in the statement of
financial position based on the present value of
defined obligations, less any unrecognised past
service costs and the fair value of plan assets.
The accounting policy requires management to
make judgements as to the nature of benefits
provided by each scheme and thereby determine
the classification of each scheme. For defined
benefit pension schemes, management is required

to make annual estimates and assumptions about
future returns on classes of scheme assets, future
remuneration changes, employee attrition rates,
administration costs, changes in benefits, inflation
rates, exchange rates, life expectancy and expected
remaining periods of service of employees.
In making these estimates and assumptions,
management considers advice provided by
external advisers, such as actuaries. Where actual
experience differs to these estimates, actuarial
gains and losses are recognised directly in the
statement of comprehensive income.

36 Possible impact
of amendments,
new standards and
interpretations
issued but not yet
effective for the
year

The IASB has issued the following amendments,
new standards and interpretations which are not yet
effective in respect of the financial years included
in these consolidated financial statements, and
which have not been adopted in these consolidated
financial statements.
The Group is in the process of making an assessment
of what the impact of these amendments, new
standards and new interpretations is expected to be
in the period of initial application but is not yet in a
position to state whether these amendments, new
standards and interpretations would have a significant
impact on the Group’s results of operations and
financial position.

Forward looking
statements

This Annual Report contains certain statements
that are, or may be deemed to be, “forwardlooking statements”. These forward-looking
statements may be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology, including the terms
“believes”, “estimates”, “plans”, “projects”,
“anticipates”, “seeks”“expects”, “intends”,
“forecasts”, “targets”, “may”, “will”, “should”,
“could” and “potential” or, in each case, their
negative or other variations, or comparable
terminology, or by discussions of strategy, plans,
objectives, goals, future events or intentions.
These forward-looking statements include
all matters that are not historical facts. They
appear in a number of places throughout this
Annual Report and include, but are not limited
to, statements regarding the Group’s intentions,
beliefs or current expectations concerning,
among other things, the Group’s business,
results of operations, financial position, liquidity,
prospects, growth, strategies and the bauxite,
alumina and aluminium industries.
By their nature, forward-looking statements
involve risk and uncertainty because they relate
to future events and circumstances. Forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and of the actual results of the
Group’s operations, financial position and liquidity,
and the development of the markets and the
industries in which the Group operates may differ
materially from the development of those same
industries as described in, or suggested by, the
forward-looking statements contained in this Annual
Report. In addition, even if the Group’s results of
operations, financial position and liquidity, and the
development of the markets and the industries in
which the Group operates, are consistent with the
forward-looking statements contained in this Annual
Report, those results or developments may not be
indicative of results or developments in subsequent

periods. A number of risks, uncertainties and other
factors could cause results and developments to
differ materially from those expressed or implied by
the forward-looking statements including, without
limitation:
– materially adverse changes in economic
or industry conditions generally or in the
markets served by the Group;
– changes in the supply and demand for and
the price of aluminium, alumina, aluminium
products and other products;
