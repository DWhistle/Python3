RUSAL’s production chain includes bauxite and nepheline ore mines, alumina reﬁneries, aluminium smelters
and casting houses, foil mills, packaging and wheels production centers.

Secured access to green, renewable
electricity
Electricity is a key component of the aluminum
production process. RUSAL’s core smelting operations
are favorably located close to the Siberian hydro power
plants sourcing from them approximately 93% of the
Group’s total electricity needs. The Company has
long term agreements with the region’s hydro-power
energy suppliers. Using renewable and environmentally
friendly hydro generated electricity, RUSAL is targeting
the lowest CO2 footprint in the industry.

Captive raw material supplies
RUSAL alumina production capacities are located
in Russia and abroad. These operations cover over
approximately 100% of the Group’s total alumina needs.
Our alumina reﬁneries bauxite needs are covered by up
to 75% with supplies from the Group’s bauxite mining

6

operations. Our existing bauxite resource base is sufﬁcient to supply for over 100 years of operations.

Efﬁcient midstream, proprietary R&D and
internal EPCM expertise
RUSAL aluminum smelting operations go through
regular upgrades. RUSAL has developed its own
in-house R&D, design and engineering centers and
operates RA-300, RA-400 and Green Soederberg
smelting technologies. A new energy efﬁcient and
environmentally friendly RA-500, RA-550 smelting
technology has been designed and currently RUSAL is
testing it, targeting the best energy efﬁciency yields in
the industry.
RUSAL is actively developing a groundbreaking inert anode technology. Introducing this state-of-art technology
into the production process will lead to complete elimination of greenhouse gas and polyaromatic hydrocarbon
emissions coupled with 10% cut in operational costs
through reducing anode and energy consumption and
over a 30% cut in Greenﬁeld projects expenditure costs.

Corporate Proﬁle

Cost efﬁciency
The efﬁcient smelting technologies together with
low cost input material and utilities mix secures the
Company’s global leadership on the cost curve.

Focus on higher margin downstream business
RUSAL has a diversiﬁed product mix with a strong share
of VAP in the portfolio (1.66 million tonnes per annum
out of 3.67 million tonnes of total sales).

Diversiﬁed sales geography
RUSAL sales mix is represented by a diversiﬁed portfolio
of regions. The Company delivers aluminium products
to the domestic market and to all key global consuming
regions (Europe, America, South East Asia).

Growth potential of the RUSAL platform
The BEMO Project (RUSAL and Rushydro JV) includes
the 3,000 megawatt BEMO HPP (the construction
of which was completed in 2014) and Boguchansky
aluminium smelter in the Krasnoyarsk region of Russia.
In March 2019, the launch of the second part of the ﬁrst
stage brought the total production capacity to almost
300 thousand tonnes per annum.
One of RUSAL’s other major projects is the Taishet
aluminium smelter in the Irkutsk region. The production
capacity of the ﬁrst line once launched will be
428.5 thousand tonnes. During 2018, the Company
continued to ﬁnance this smelter’s construction using its
own funds. It is important to note that the launch of these
projects is happening when the market is experiencing a
growing aluminium deﬁcit.

Implementing environmental initiatives
RUSAL was one of the ﬁrst Russian companies that joined
UN Global Compact. By following its environmental
policy and undertaking to regularly review and update
its provisions, the Company is constantly developing and
improving its environmental management system and
implementing its principles at all production facilities. In
1

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

2017 RUSAL has launched a new low carbon aluminium
brand, ALLOW, which features a signiﬁcantly lower carbon
footprint – speciﬁc volume of greenhouse gas emissions
– as compared to industry average (4t CO2/t Al vs 12.3t
CO2/t Al of world average (scope 1 and 2 at the smelter).
The Company ﬁrst veriﬁed its ALLOW brand in 2018 with
the help of the international auditor KPMG. In 2017, 77%
of the Company’s output was attributed to this brand. The
computations followed the methodology contained in
the International Aluminium Institute’s carbon footprint
reporting guidelines published in February 2018.

Diversiﬁcation opportunities through
investments
— As at the Latest Practicable Date, RUSAL owns an effective 27.82% interest in Norilsk Nickel, the world’s
largest nickel and palladium producer and one of the
leading producers of platinum and copper1.

CHAIRMAN'S
STATEMENT

Bernard Zonneveld
Chairman of the Board

Dear Shareholders,
I am delighted to welcome you to RUSAL’s Annual
Report for 2018. It is a pleasure to address you for the
ﬁrst time as Chairman of the new Board of Directors of
a leading global aluminium producer.
Firstly, I would like to reassure you that the new Board
of Directors represents an international group of extremely qualiﬁed and experienced professionals. We
are prepared to take any necessary actions, above and
beyond what OFAC has required of the Company, to
demonstrate the Board’s absolute commitment to
transparency, accountability and good corporate governance, as we lead the business on to new achievements.
Following the lifting of U.S. sanctions, I can see the Company’s immense potential to further grow into a highperforming business with excellent sustainable assets,
proprietary technologies and talented personnel. I am
pleased to say that RUSAL is in a strong position to face
the market challenges, with our innovative technologies
and our focus on low carbon footprint production.
12

Chairman’s Statement

The 2018 results demonstrate RUSAL’s solid position in its core business: revenue increased by 3.1% to
USD10,280 million, and the Company recorded a net
proﬁt of USD1,698 million, a 39.0% increase compared
to the previous year. In 2018, the average aluminium realized price increased by 7.3% compared to the previous year and amounted to USD2,259 per tonne. The average realized premium component decreased by 6.7%
compared to 2017 and dropped to USD152 per tonne.
RUSAL continued to honor interest and coupon payments.
During the ﬁnancial year total debt slightly decreased by
USD193 million as a result of scheduled payments.
In January 2018, RUSAL successfully completed its
third Eurobond issuance. More than 100 investors from
across Europe, America, Russia and Asia, participated in
the order book for RUSAL’s new Eurobond issuance,
which exceeded USD1.5 billion. The successful placement of the issue provides further evidence of RUSAL’s
compelling investment case, which continues to thrive
from a strong support from the global investor community. This transaction further improves the Company’s
debt proﬁle and its ability to pursue exciting new business opportunities.
RUSAL continued to expand its resource base and ensure its long-term stability. Out of RUSAL’s CAPEX in
2018 (USD834 million), 54% was set aside for the development of its key projects, to support the Company’s
competitive advantages of vertical integration into raw
materials and product mix enhancements. As an example, in June 2018, RUSAL launched two key projects
aimed at increasing the Company’s self-sufﬁciency in
sourcing raw materials: the Dian-Dian bauxite deposit
and Friguia alumina reﬁnery complex.
Another example is the BEMO project, a 50/50 joint
venture with RusHydro, which is an industrial complex
in Siberia combining the BEMO HPP and Boguchansky
aluminium smelters. The second part of the ﬁrst stage
was launched in March 2019 and brought the total production capacity to almost 300 kt per annum.
One of RUSAL’s other major projects is the Taishet
aluminium smelter in the Irkutsk region. The production capacity of the ﬁrst line is 428.5 thousand tonnes.
During the course of 2018, the Company continued to
ﬁnance this smelter’s construction using its own funds.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

It is important to note that the launch of these projects
is happening when the market is experiencing a growing
aluminium deﬁcit. At the same time, there are no new
signiﬁcant supply increase projects currently carried
out outside of China (excluding RUSAL).
RUSAL is committed to meeting the market’s high demands for low-carbon footprint products, evidenced by
the Company’s gradual reduction of the CO2 emissions
at its sites. As the challenges of climate change become more threatening, RUSAL continues to enhance
its commitment to producing “green aluminium”. Total
primary consumption of low-carbon aluminium (LCA) is
estimated to surpass the 4 million tonnes threshold by
2022, according to the Company’s calculations. As more
companies ranging from the automobile to technology industries are seeking to reduce their carbon footprint through both their production and supply chains,
RUSAL is seeking to gain a 25% share of the market
with its ALLOW brand.
The Company pays great attention to the social and
economic development of the region in which it operates, both in Russia and overseas. Since 2014, RUSAL
has been actively engaged in the process of ﬁghting
the spread of the Ebola virus in the Republic of Guinea, through the construction of medical infrastructure
and the development of the GamEvac-Combi vaccine.
In 2018, during the testing program conducted at the
Scientiﬁc Diagnostic Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, RUSAL provided two thousand people with
the vaccination against Ebola in the Republic of Guinea.
The vaccine is currently in the ﬁnal round of testing.
I hope that the vaccine will help combat the Ebola virus
in West Africa and ensure that it becomes a disease of
the past.
Finally, I would like to thank all our stakeholders including our shareholders, employees and executive team
members for their commitment and support during the
past year. I am proud to say that 2018 has proven that
the Company is ready to face and overcome unexpected obstacles. Despite the challenges over the last year,
RUSAL remains in good shape and is ready to deliver
growth and value.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

CEO’S
REVIEW

Evgenii Nikitin
Chief Executive Officer

Despite the OFAC Sanctions, RUSAL’s robust full year
results demonstrated skillful crisis management alongside the ability to adapt to a new operations’ environment. We maintained a strong market position through
high managerial competence and operational ﬂexibility.
In 2018, aluminium production totaled 3,753 thousand
tonnes which is a 1.2% increase compared to the prior
year. Total production dynamics remained largely stable
with capacity utilization reaching 96%. Value-added
products (VAP)2 sales amounted to 1,664 thousand
tonnes with the share of VAP sales sitting at 45%.
Production cost per tonne in the aluminium segment
amounted to USD 1,646 and increased by 9.2% in 2018
compared to the same period of 2017. This was due to
signiﬁcant price increases in alumina, as well as the increase in the prices of other raw materials.

2 VAP includes alloyed ingots, slabs, billets, wire rod, wheels, high and special purity aluminium.

14

CEO’s Review

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The Company continues to carry out its strategy to increase share of VAP sales by investing in new alloys. In
February 2018, RUSAL completed the feasibility study
for the construction of a scandium oxide production
unit. The technology processes red mud from alumina
reﬁneries and makes scandium oxide as a by-product,
which signiﬁcantly improves the end-user performance of aluminium alloys.

of all aluminium produced at the Company’s smelters
in 2017 could be included in the ALLOW brand.

In 2018, RUSAL continued to cut direct speciﬁc greenhouse gas emissions at existing aluminium smelters as
a part of the corporate strategy to reduce emissions
by 15% by 2025 compared to 2014. During 2018 our
level of emissions amounted to 2.11 MT CO2eq./MT,
7.5% lower than the levels registered in 2014 (2.28 MT
CO2eq./MT).

To conclude, the key achievement of the year is that despite the challenging times, the Company has remained
operational whilst carefully navigating and avoiding
any seismic personnel cuts and managing to save wellestablished multi-industrial supply chains in the countries where it has operations. 2018 has shown customers and investors that our business model continues to
remain efﬁcient and robust.

In 2018, KPMG conducted an audit to prove the accuracy of the Company’s measurements of CO2 emissions.
Upon veriﬁcation of the compliance of the aluminium
production to the CO2 emissions requirements of low
carbon aluminium brand ALLOW, launched by RUSAL
two years ago, the Company has established that 77%

In December 2018, RUSAL’s commitment to sustainability and best international practices was acknowledged by Vigeo Eiris, a reputable international ratings
agency. RUSAL was listed among the top 100 Best
Emerging Markets performers.

Business Overview

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Business Unit
Aluminium
RUSAL owns 103 aluminium smelters which are located
in two countries: Russia (nine plants) and Sweden
(one plant). The Company’s core asset base is located
in Siberia, Russia, accounting for approximately 93%
of the Company’s aluminium output in 2018. Among
those, BrAZ and KrAZ together account for more than
half of RUSAL’s aluminium production. The Company
owns 85% of a smelter located in Nigeria.
During 2018, RUSAL continued to implement
a comprehensive program designed to control costs and
optimize the production process in order to strengthen
the Company’s position as one of the world’s most
cost-efﬁcient aluminium producers.

RUSAL decided to suspend the project in 2009.
After the economic recovery and market conditions
improvement in 2016, the Board of Directors decided
to resume construction of LC-1 (ﬁrst series) of the
Taishet Smelter and approved start of preparatory work
to resume construction. Actual construction of the
Taishet Smelter resumed in 2017.
The project includes construction of an aluminum
smelter in the town Taishet of the Irkutsk Region
(Eastern Siberia) with a design production capacity
of the LC-1 (ﬁrst series) is 352 pots or 428.5 kt per
annum. Electricity consumed by the LC-1 (ﬁrst series) is
6,370 million kWh.
As of 31 December 2018, RUSAL invested
USD792 million (excluding VAT) in the LC-1 (ﬁrst series)
construction project.

Alumina
BEMO project
The BEMO project involves the construction of the
3,000 MW BEMO HPP and the BEMO aluminium
smelter in the Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia.
The construction of the BEMO aluminium smelter is
divided into two stages (each phase with capacity for
298 kt of aluminium per annum). The ﬁrst part of the
ﬁrst stage (149 kt of aluminium per annum, 168 pots)
was launched in 2015 and the second part of the ﬁrst
stage was launched in March 2019. The second stage
of BEMO smelter (approximately 300 kt per annum) is
to be considered with strategic partner RusHydro after
the full ramp up of the ﬁrst stage and subject to market
situation and availability of project ﬁnancing.

Taishet Aluminum Smelter
Construction of Taishet Aluminum Smelter was
started in 2006. Due to unfavorable market conditions,

3 10 aluminium smelters in operation.

The Group owns 8 alumina reﬁneries as at the end
of 2018. RUSAL’s alumina reﬁneries are located in
six countries: Ireland (one plant), Jamaica (one plant),
Ukraine (one plant), Italy (one plant), Russia (three
plants) and Guinea (one plant). In addition, the Company
holds a 20% equity stake in QAL, an alumina reﬁnery
located in Australia. Most of the Group’s reﬁneries
have ISO 9001 certiﬁed quality control systems. Four
reﬁneries and QAL are ISO 14001 certiﬁed for their
environmental management and three reﬁneries have
received OHSAS 18001 certiﬁcation for their health
and safety management systems.
The Company’s long position in alumina capacity
helps to secure sufﬁcient supply for the prospective
expansion of the Company’s aluminium production
capacity and allows the Company to take advantage
of favorable market conditions through third-party
alumina sales.

Business Overview

The main factors which had an inﬂuence on the Group’s
production performance:
— Achinsk Alumina Reﬁnery. A program of partial substitution of costly bright coal with the ligneous coal
for sintering purposes is ongoing. A project of wet
exhaust gas scrubbers installation at sintering kilns
has been partially completed.
— Bogoslovsk Alumina Reﬁnery. Digester productivity
has been increased by means of reciprocating
piston pump stock upgrade (GEHO and FELUWA
units). Condition of bauxite slurry heaters has been
improved. Productivity of sintering kilns has been
increased by means of lowering slurry moisture.
— Urals Alumina Reﬁnery. Timan bauxite quality
improvement (by Al2O3 content), allowing overall
production output increase even above the plant’s
capacity.
— Nikolaev Alumina Reﬁnery. Partial substitution of
C.B.K. bauxite with bauxite from other deposits (with
higher Al2O3 content) led to an overall production
increase even above the plant’s capacity.
— Aughinish Alumina Reﬁnery. Dian-Dian bauxite
consumption successfully started. Also new deep
thickener was installed and commissioned.
— Friguia Alumina Reﬁnery. The plant successfully
resumed operation after long-term conservation
(since 2012). First production unit was put in service
in May 2018. The plant reached its 50% capacity in
4Q 2018. It is planned to continue its capacity ramp
up in 2019 to achieve full-scaled operations of 600kt
per annum.

Bauxite
The Group operates seven bauxite mines. RUSAL’s
bauxite mines are located in four countries: Russia
(two mines), Jamaica (one mine), Guyana (one mine) and
Guinea (three mines). The Company’s long position in
bauxite capacity helps to secure sufﬁcient supply for
the prospective expansion of the Company’s alumina
production capacity and allows the Company to take
advantage of favorable market conditions through thirdparty bauxite sales.
In April 2018, Verkhne-Shugoskoe new mine deposit
commenced operation at Timan Bauxite.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The increase in Timan bauxite capacity in 2018 relative to
2017 is associated with the launch of mining at the new
Verkhne-Shugoskoe deposit and the continued mine
development of the current Vezho-Vorykvinskoe deposit.
Capacities of Compagnie des Bauxites de Kindia in 2018
upon the achieved results of extraction of 3,451 thousand
tonnes with the same quantity and equipment structure.
Securing the supply of high quality bauxite at adequate
volumes and cost competitive prices for its alumina
facilities is an important objective for the Company.
Additional exploratory work is being undertaken to
locate new deposits of bauxite in the Group’s existing
operational bauxite mining areas and in new project areas.
Each of the Group’s mining assets is operated under one
or more licenses.
As at 31 December 2018, the Group had JORC attributable
bauxite Mineral Resources of 1,834.6 million tonnes,
of which 489.3 million tonnes were measured, 714.8
million tonnes were indicated and 630.5 million tonnes
were inferred. Due to the introduction of new ﬁeld
development projects on Timan and North Urals bauxite
mine the reevaluation of resources was made.

Energy assets
BEMO Project
BEMO HPP is the fourth step of the Angara hydroelectric
power chain, the biggest major hydro-power plant
completed project in Russia. Construction of the power
plant was suspended in Soviet times due to the lack of
ﬁnancing and was resumed in May 2006 by RUSAL and
RusHydro following the conclusion of their agreement
to jointly implement the BEMO project comprising
the BEMO HPP (the average annual electricity output
reaching 17.6 billion kWh) and an aluminium smelter
capable of producing 600,000 tonnes of metal per year.
The project’s 79 meters high and 2,587 meters long
composite gravity and rock-ﬁll dam was completed at the
end of 2011 and nine 333 MW hydropower units of the
BEMO HPP commenced operation during 2012-2014.
The total installed capacity of all nine hydro-units in
operation amounts to 2,997 MW.

In 2018, a mining equipment renovation project was
completed at BCGI.
In June 2018, Dian-Dian mine commenced operation.

Company profile and Financial Results8
Norilsk Nickel’s resource base in Taimyr and Kola
Peninsula as at 31 December 2017, consists of 815
million tonnes of Proved and Probable Ore Reserves
and 2,047 million tonnes of Measured Mineral and
Indicated Mineral Resources. Its key assets are located
in the Norilsk region, the Kola Peninsula and the TransBaikal Territory in Russia, with foreign production
assets located in Finland and South Africa.
In 2018, Norilsk Nickel produced 219 thousand
tonnes of nickel, 474 thousand tonnes of copper,
2,729 thousand troy ounces of palladium and
653 thousand troy ounces of platinum. Compared to
2017, it is to be noted that:

1. Growth in production of nickel (+1%) mostly due to
the increase in processed volumes of Russian feed
as a result of downstream reconﬁguration and processing of accumulated work-in-progress inventories (for information: production of nickel from own
Russian feed increased by 3%);
2. Growth in production of copper (+18%) mostly due
to the ramp up of Bystrinsky Project, increase of
processed volumes of concentrate purchased from
Rostec and reduced metal losses in recovery of copper into copper concentrate (Talnakh Concentrator
reaching its design parameters after modernization)
(for information: production of Copper from own
Russian feed increased by 19%);
3. Decrease in PGM production (-2% palladium, -3%
platinum) mostly due to the decrease of third party
feed processing (for information: production of
PGM from own Russian feed in 2018 was approximately the same as in 2017).

During 2017 Norilsk Nickel’s net working capital
signiﬁcantly increased from USD0.5 billion to
USD2.1 billion due to one-off factors (e.g. metal inventory
increase, optimization of capital structure, etc.). However,
in 2018, the net working capital reduced to normal level
(around USD1.0 billion as deﬁned by the management
of Norilsk Nickel) by means of sale of metal stocks
accumulated in 2017 and optimization of capital structure.
As of 31 December 2018, the net working capital reduced
by 60% down to USD0.9 billion (from USD2.1 billion as of
31 December 2017).
Company’s Strategy and Key Investment Projects
On 19 November 2018, Norilsk Nickel introduced an
update of its new strategy in London and conﬁrmed its
key strategic priorities:
1. Focus on Health, Safety and Environment: annual
LTIFR reduction by 20%, zero tolerance for fatalities, and the launch of the comprehensive environmental program aiming at sulfar dioxide emissions
reduction by 75% in polar division;
9 PGMs – platinum group metals.

2. Efﬁciency improvements: short-term metal production growth of 5-8%, stringent cost control – maintaining total cash cost inﬂation below inﬂation rate,
and labour productivity growth of up to 15% from
2017 to 2020;
3. Long-term production growth targets for the existing asset base: Talnakh brownﬁeld projects, South
Cluster development (Zapolyarniy mine, Medveziy
Ruchey open-pit and Norilsk Concentrator), and
third stage of Talnakh concentrator upgrade;
4. “Blue Sky” projects and cooperation down the value chain: early stage evaluation of potentially the
world’s largest Greenﬁeld PGMs9 cluster through
a joint venture with Russian Platinum Plc (one of
the leading PGM producer in Russia); and strategic cooperation with BASF in fast growing battery
materials sector.
Bystrinsky Project (50%+1 Norilsk Nickel, 36.6% CIS
Natural Resources Fund and 13.3% China’s Highland
Fund) is ramping up, full operational capacity is

Business Overview

expected to be reached in 2020. Potential IPO of
Bystrinsky Project in 2020 is considered as a strategic
option for further value creation of the asset (terms and
conditions to be determined in the second half of 2019).
On 7 February 2018, Norilsk Nickel and Russian Platinum
signed a framework agreement on strategic partnership.
According to the agreement, the parties will establish
a joint venture to develop disseminated ore deposits
in the Norilsk Industrial District. The joint venture will
be 50%-owned by Norilsk Nickel and 50%-owned by
Russian Platinum. Norilsk Nickel will contribute to the
joint venture its license for Maslovskoe deposit, while
Russian Platinum will contribute its licenses for the
South ﬂank of Norilsk-1 and Chernogorskoe deposits.
On 22 October 2018, it was announced that BASF
has selected Harjavalta, Finland, as the ﬁrst location
for battery materials production serving the European
automotive market. The plant will be constructed
adjacent to the nickel and cobalt reﬁnery owned
by Norilsk Nickel. In addition, BASF and Norilsk
Nickel have signed a long-term, market-based supply
agreement for nickel and cobalt feedstocks from Norilsk
Nickel’s metal reﬁnery. The agreement will establish
a locally sourced and secure supply of raw materials for
a battery production in Europe.

Settlement with Interros in relation to
Norilsk Nickel
On 10 December 2012, Interros (which holds
approximately 30.4%10 of Norilsk Nickel shares),
RUSAL (which holds approximately 27.82%11 of Norilsk
Nickel shares), Crispian (which holds approximately
4.2%12 of Norilsk Nickel shares) and the respective
beneﬁcial owners of Interros and Crispian, namely,
Mr. Potanin and Mr. Abramovich, entered into an
agreement (the ‘Agreement’) to improve the existing
corporate governance and transparency of the Norilsk
Nickel Group, to maximize proﬁtability and shareholder
value and to settle the disagreements of RUSAL and
Interros in relation to the Norilsk Nickel Group.
In 2015, Norilsk Nickel’s commitments pertaining to
special dividends were fulﬁlled in advance (special
dividends were paid out during 2014-2015, including
dividend pursuant to the Norilsk Nickel’s shareholder
resolution resolved in the annual general meeting on
13 May 2015).

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

On 5 April 2016, the Company entered into the side
letter with the parties to the Agreement pursuant
to which the Agreement was further amended (the
“Amendments”), among others, to the following effect
on the dividend policy of Norilsk Nickel:

Dividend Policy of Norilsk Nickel
Starting 2017 and each subsequent year, the annual
dividends payable by Norilsk Nickel shall be determined
on the basis of the ratio of Norilsk Nickel’s Net Debt
to Norilsk Nickel’s EBITDA as of 31 December of the
preceding year as follows:

1. 60% of EBITDA if the ratio is 1.8 and less;
2. 30% of EBITDA if the ratio is 2.2 and more; and
3. if the ratio falls between 1.8 and 2.2, the percentage
of EBITDA to be paid as dividends shall be calculated as follows: X% = 60% — (Net Debt/EBITDA
— 1.8)/0.4 · 30%.
Starting 2018, the minimal amount of the annual
dividends payable by Norilsk Nickel shall not be less
than USD1 billion.
Potential disposal of 6,313,994 ordinary shares held by
Crispian in Norilsk Nickel (3.99% of Norilsk Nickel shares)
On 10 December 2012, the Company entered into
a settlement agreement (“Framework Agreement”) with
Interros International Investments Limited (“Interros”)
and LLC “Millhouse” and their repective beneﬁcial
owners to resolve their dispute relating to interests
in Norilsk Nickel, details of which are set out in the
circular of the Company dated 25 June 2014. As part
of the Framework Agreement, with a view to create
a balanced system of speciﬁc rights and obligations,
each of the Company and Interros were required to
transfer shares (totally approximately 5.87% stake in
Norilsk Nickel) in Norilsk Nickel to Crispian.
On 6 February 2018, RUSAL received a letter from
Crispian (the “Letter”) informing that Crispian had
received an offer from Bonico Holdings Co Ltd to buy
6,313,994 ordinary shares held by Crispian in Norilsk

Business Overview

Nickel (the “Offered Shares”). By the Letter, Crispian
purported to give each of the Company and Whiteleave
Holdings Limited (who replaced Interros as a party to
the Framework Agreement) (“Whiteleave”) a notice of
a right of the ﬁrst refusal to acquire the Offered Shares
on the terms of a non-negotiable sale and purchase
agreement derived from the terms and conditions of
the offer (“ROFR”). The Company understood at the
time that Whiteleave has accepted the ROFR.
RUSAL contended that the Letter is invalid and, hence,
it contends that any sale of shares in Norilsk Nickel by
Crispian pursuant to the Letter or pursuant to a purported
acceptance of the Letter, or in consequence of an actual
or (supposed) deemed rejection of Letter and/or the
ROFR is also invalid under the Framework Agreement.
On 12 February 2018, the Company commenced its
legal challenge to the validity of the Letter in the High
Court in London pursuant to the dispute resolution
mechanisms set out in the Framework Agreement.
On 27 June 2018, the High Court in London issued its
decision in relation to the Company’s legal challenge.
The decision was that the ROFR was invalid and
ineffective such that Crispian was and is precluded
under the Framework Agreement from disposing the
offered shares pursuant to it. As a result, the share
purchase agreement between Whiteleave and Crispian
was unwounded. Such decision may be subject to
further hearing, including applications for appeal.

Potential acquisition or disposal of shares in
Norilsk Nickel
Pursuant to the Framework Agreement, each of the
Company and Interros were not to sell or otherwise
alienate its shares in Norilsk Nickel until the expiry of
the lock-up of 5 years from the date of the Framework
Agreement. Upon the expiry of the lock-up period, either
party may initiate a “shoot out” between themselves by
offering a price of not less than the 6-month weighted
average price fo the shares of Norilsk Nickel immediately
prior to the offer date plus 20% at any time and more than
one time after the lock-up period (the “Shoot Out”). The
offeree party shall either sell its stake in Norilsk Nickel at
the offer price, buy the stake of the offering party or ask
for a higher price. If it asks for a higher price, the offering
party is obliged either to buy the stake of the offeree
party for this higher price, or sell its stake at that price.
On 23 February 2018, RUSAL announced that it proposed
to seek the approval of Shareholders, at an extraordinary
general meeting of the Company by way of poll, of an
acquisition mandate and a disposal mandate which
would authorize the Board to effect (i.e. to initiate or

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

respond to an offer under) a potential Shoot Out. Such
mandates, if approved by Shareholders at an extraordinary
general meeting, would give the Board the ﬂexibility to
expediently make an offer to buy the stake of Whiteleave
(which replaced Interros as a party to the Framework
Agreement) in Norilsk Nickel or, to accept an offer to
sell its stake in Norilsk Nickel to Whiteleave, given
the circumstances that a Shoot Out may be imminent.
Any acquisition or disposal of shares in Norilsk Nickel
pursuant to a Shoot Out will constitute a very substantial
acquisition or disposal of the Company.
On 13 April 2018, following the inclusion of the Company
into the SDN List issued by OFAC, RUSAL announced
that it would not proceed to seek the Shareholders’
approval of the mandates for the Board to effect a Shoot
Out transaction.

Corporate Strategy
As at 31 December 2018, RUSAL’s strategy is to ensure
its long-term sustainable development in challenging
market environment through the following strategic
moves:
1. Increasing low-cost and high-efﬁciency production capacities and sales of VAP products. Further
strengthening position on key markets including CIS,
Europe, Asia and America markets.
2. Maintaining RUSAL’s position as one of the most efﬁcient and lowest cost producers.
3. Focus on innovations for core business and new
products developments.
4. Sustainable and environmentally friendly aluminium.

Group-Wide Initiatives
Innovations and research projects and new super
powerful reduction cells
The Company has been successfully operating the RA550 super powerful reduction cells that were initially put
into operation in the experimental industrial shop of the
Sayanogorsk aluminium smelter. The new reduction cells
have proved capable to deliver the best energy efﬁciency
and environmental performance in the world: current
efficiency: 96%, power consumption of below 12,800
kWh, and fluoride emissions of under 0.15 kg/t. The
stable operation of the RA-550 reduction has tromped
a number of innovative technical solutions to the highamperage processes that shape the new standard in
the industry: a fundamentally new configuration of
the busbar with a two-line current supply, providing
a symmetrical magnetic field and high MHD stability
without a compensating loop; and a modular design of
27

Business Overview

the busbar eliminating the constraints on the design of
super powerful reduction cells operating at amperages in
excess of 750 kA.
Environmental approach
The Green Soederberg process included in the list
of the best available technologies in Russia is being
successfully developed and improved upon in all key areas.
Two-stage gas scrubbing comprising dry and wet
scrubbing stages is among the best gas scrubbing
processes in the world and can remove not only
ﬂuorides but also sulphur (SO2) from the exhaust fumes.
RUSAL has patented a new pot gas scrubbing block that
it designed itself. Now all the gas scrubbers installed
at the aluminium smelters of RUSAL utilize the new
scrubbing process that compared to other scrubbing
processes, has a high efﬁciency per CAPEX (CAPEX
on equipment is reduced by over 30%), as well as high
ﬂuoride and SO2 removal effectiveness (99% and 96.5%
respectively).
The improved design of the reduction cell degassing
system has boosted degassing efﬁciency to over
97.4% while reducing the cost; and the centralized
manufacture of the new units was organized at the iron
casting facilities of RUSAL.
The automatic raw materials feeding systems that
RUSAL has developed for its reduction cells as well as
the production process control systems, the reduction
cell tending equipment (new machines for loading
alumina into reduction cells MZGV and systems for
removing dust in MPU pot rooms) and innovative
comprehensive gas scrubbing process have reduced
the emissions of the main type of ﬂuoride based
contaminants (F, ﬂuorides) by a factor of 3.5 relative to
the standard Soederberg process. This has brought the
environmental performance of the Green Soederberg
process really close to baked anode reduction. In
October 2018 environmental measurements were
taken that conﬁrmed that the new process meets
the requirements of Russia's List of Best Available
Technologies.
To ensure the Company always has access to raw
materials and to strengthen the status of the Green
Soederberg process as an environmentally friendly
technology in terms of polyaromatic emissions, a new
process was developed for making environmentally
friendly pitch using low temperature coal dissolution

28

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

and mixing with petroleum ingredients and low content
of the products of the chemical coke production process
(less than 30-40%). The new process is the only one of its
kind in the world. In addition, new production processes
are being designed and trialled at the industrial scale
such as the hybrid and compound pitch processes that
reduce the content of benzopyrene several-fold by
replacing coal pitch with petroleum ingredients.
The Company has been making some signiﬁcant
efforts to minimize its carbon footprint. To that end,
mathematical and physics models have been used to
determine the optimal design of an industrial inert anode,
which has conﬁrmed the feasibility of inert anodes
under industrial conditions in KrAZ reduction cells.
Additional equipment was installed in the casthouses
and an inert anode plant commenced operation; the
new inert anode plant has enough capacity to supply
inert anodes not only for the experimental production
area but at an industrial scale.
Recycling
In order to boost the energy efﬁciency of aluminium
production at relatively short pay back periods, tests are
being carried out and new energy efﬁcient reduction
cell designs are being introduced at KrAZ, BrAZ, SAZ,
NkAZ and IrkAZ. Electricity consumption per tonne of
output was reduced by 200-400 kWh per tonne.
The use of bulk lining materials in pot rebuilds reduces
the costs by RUB80,000-120,000 per cathode as a result
of the lower prices of bulk lining materials and reduced
labour intensity of installation. Furthermore, spent bulk
lining materials can be recycled. Bulk materials proved to
have a recycling rate of up to 50%. The introduction of
bulk materials at 330 reduction cells at SAZ has already
allowed the smelter to save more than RUB20 million.
Product engineering
A new aluminium zirconium alloy was developed for the
drawing of wire and for use in cable shields. A new wire
manufacturing process was developed and introduced
at IrkAZ (the ExtruForm® line). Wire made from the
new alloy was tested as a shield for a high voltage
cable by VNIIKP; its effectiveness in this capacity was
conﬁrmed and the new material was approved for use
as a replacement for copper. Amendments to state
standards are currently under development to allow
aluminium and aluminium based alloys to be used as
cable shields.

Business Overview

As part of the efforts to further develop the ExtruForm®
production line and expand the product range a
production process was developed to make wire rod
from an AMg series alloy that has a 3% magnesium
content. The wire rod was tested as a raw material
for making welding wire under industrial conditions
and the consumer found the quality of the resulting
product to be quite satisfactory. The line was retroﬁtted
by installing a new casting block preheater to allow the
production of high magnesium content alloys.
Research and development was carried out to reﬁne the
existing production processes in order to reduce the
ﬂow rate of the AlTiB alloying rod during the casting of
billets. As a result of the retroﬁtting the average alloying
rod ﬂow rate was reduced by 15-17% for the 6XXX series
alloys. The new and improved process was successfully
tested at SAZ. A new process was also developed and
introduced at BrAZ for casting 1070 alloy ingots without
the feathery structure defect.
New powder alloys were developed for additive
fabrication; and the new alloys offer improved
performance at high temperatures: the alloys are based
on the aluminium copper (PC-230) system and the AlSiNi (PC-390) system. Basic 3D printing parameters were
developed for the new alloys. Tests have demonstrated
that the new alloys can be used at temperatures of 200250C. The PC-320 alloy, developed earlier, was used to
3D-print a part that was successfully bench-tested as a
replacement for a cast part. Subsequent optimization of
the shape of the part reduced its weight by 33%, which
was made possible by the new 3D printing process as
it delivers improved strength performance when used
with the new material.
A 3D printing laboratory was organized on the premises
of the Institute for Light Materials and Technologies;
it is equipped with an EOS 3D printer and auxiliary
equipment for the preparation of powders and the
ﬁnishing of 3D printed parts. Since the launch over 30
parts have been successfully manufactured from the new
aluminium alloys for use in a broad range of industries.
New slabs were manufactured from a new aluminium
alloys for railroad tanker cars at KrAZ. Ingots were
processed into slabs. Modelling based on preliminary
tests of the material demonstrated that the weight of the
tanker car from the new alloy will be 37% less than that
of a tanker car made from the AD0 alloy. Certiﬁcation
tests of the new material have been launched to obtain
approval for its use in railroad equipment.
The content of the 6,063 alloy was optimized (within the
speciﬁcation ranges) for casting billets used in pressing

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

in order to make them easier to work with. A test lot
of billets was produced by VgAZ for further trials. Trials
of the billets by customers operating pressing facilities
found that the pressing rate for billets made from
optimized alloys is 20-30% faster than the pressing rate
for standard alloy billets.
We continue to develop more Al-Mg-0.1 Sc alloys
with a view to cutting costs even further. A part
manufactured from a forged block made from the
P-1580 alloy successfully completed bench tests, and
the manufactured sheets and forged products were
studied when used in welding and cold stamping. The
alloy exhibited signiﬁcantly better properties than
its counterparts: it was found to be 50% stronger
compared to AMg alloys, which means it can be
used as a replacement for Al-Mg and Al-Cu alloys.
Tests on rolling mills demonstrated that sheets can
be successfully made from thicker slabs (over 560
mm thick), which means the rolling yield ratio can be
signiﬁcantly increased.
In 2018, over 60 units of casting furnishing for slabs
were designed and manufactured in-house and then
used in the casthouses at KrAZ, SAZ and BrAZ on
Wagstaff casting machines.
Innovations and Scientific Projects in Alumina Production
The red mud recycling process used by alumina
reﬁneries to extract scandium oxide as a by-product
has been reﬁned and improved upon: the yield of the
process has been increased while the consumption
of key reagents has been reduced. As a result the
production cost was reduced to USD480 per kg of Sc2O3,
which was conﬁrmed on an experimental industrial unit
(RUSAL Kamensk-Uralsky). The process continues to
be optimized: additional improvements made in the
laboratory can potentially reduce production costs
further to USD350 per kg. The laboratory results are to
be veriﬁed in the main production area in early 2019.
The quality of scandium oxide was improved to 99.9%
and a 2% Al-Sc foundry alloy was produced that is fully
compliant with GOST R 53777-2010.
A new stage has been completed in the project to
develop an aluminium chloride production process
for making alumina from non-bauxite raw materials: it
involved the construction of a mini-plant; and the next
stage is the creation of an experimental industrial unit
with a capacity of 2,000 tonnes per year at the Achinsk
Alumina Reﬁnery.

29

Business Overview

In order to improve the efﬁciency of the project
successful studies were carried out into methods to
recycle the production waste (Si-stoff) into a broad
range of commodities (silica gel, liquid glass, absorbents
and a foaming ﬁre retardant mix).
Laboratory technical solutions were developed to adapt
the aluminium chloride process for the production of
value-added products such as pseudoboehmite, which
is used as a raw material for oil reﬁnery catalysts. In
Russia there is a demand for about 20,000 tonnes of this
product every year, which means that continued work in
this area holds a signiﬁcant promise commercially.
A new production process has been developed for
making highly dispersed precipitated aluminium
hydroxide, a material that is used as a ﬁre retardant.
The low production costs results from the fact that
the product is m ade from the slurries of the Achinsk
Alumina Reﬁnery, using the one-of-a-kind process
for making alumina from nepheline. The new process
for making highly dispersed precipitated aluminium
hydroxide has completed all the requisite laboratory
and ﬁeld tests. Consumers were sent samples of the
material and reported it was good enough for making
compounds. It is currently estimated that there is
a market for more than 15,000 tonnes per year for this
product in Russia alone. Work has begun on the ﬁrst
stage of a 5,000 tonne-per-year production line at the
Achinsk Alumina Reﬁnery.
The company implemented a number of projects to
boost the efﬁciency of its existing alumina reﬁneries.
Retroﬁtting was completed of decanters 2, 3 and washer
5/1 in digestion areas 2 and 3 at RUSAL Krasnoturyinsk.
Optimal red mud thickening modes were selected. The
productivity of the retroﬁtted units was doubled.
The ﬁve time mud washing process was introduced
in production area No. 8 at UAZ. During the
implementation of the project the caustic and alumina
content in the liquid portion of the waste mud was
reduced by 25%.
A new process was developed at RUSAL KamenskUralsky to use the spent tricalcium aluminate as a lime
supplement during leaching, which should reduce the
consumption of lime per tonne of output by about 10 kg
per tonne. In 2019 the new process is to be ﬁeld-tested
and introduced into production.
RUSAL Kamensk-Uralsky completed the construction
of the replacement precipitation module in production
area No. 6, which is now operating at design capacity.

30

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The launch of the replacement battery increased
the throughput of the precipitation area by 15% and
improved the alumina size management process.
New technical solutions were developed on the basis
of computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) to allow the
heat exchangers to be brought back into operation for
non-contact heating of the thick slurry at the Ewarton
facility. The project boosted output by 9,900 tonnes
per year for alumina while reducing soda consumption
by 3.7 kg per tonne of alumina. The new process is to
be fully deployed in 2019. Mathematical modelling was
carried out and the most electromagnetic stirrer was
selected for the stirring of raw slurry at BAZ, which
reduces its incrustation. As part of fundamental CFD
modelling research methodologies were developed for
using the CFD method to model the ﬂocculation and
decantation processes; the new methodologies are on
a par with the best such methods currently available in
the world.
Upgrade and Development
The Company continues
development areas:

into

main

1. Improving self-sufﬁciency;
2. Reducing production costs and boosting production efﬁciency;
3. Higher share of value-added products (aluminium
alloys) in the total output.
Raw Material Self-Sufficiency
— In March 2018, IrkAZ’s calcination kiln achieves
design capacity of 9.5 tonnes per hour of calcined
coke, marking the completion of the project aimed
at retroﬁtting the kiln. The kiln’s new output of
69.7 thousand tonnes per year of petroleum coke
calcined in-house in 2018 allowed the company to
reduce the amount of imported petroleum coke it
needs to buy for the SAZ carbon plant. The quality of the calcined coke produced in-house meet
all the requirements and match the quality of the
imported raw material;
— VgAZ (up to 105 thousand tonnes per year of baked
anodes) with own calcined coke capacity was
launched in August 2018;
— The Taishet anode plant is implementing a new
construction stage that includes an anode baking
furnace with a capacity of 217.5 thousand tonnes
of baked anodes per year. All the main production
equipment needed for the project has already been
purchased and currently construction and installation are underway.

Business Overview

Cutting costs and boosting production efficiency
— The full scale implementation continues of a comprehensive program to deploy the Green Soederberg production process across the aluminium
smelters of the Company.
Over 80% of the reduction cells at the Krasnoyarsk
aluminium smelter have been converted to the new
standard (254 reduction cells were retroﬁtted in 2018).
At the Bratsk aluminium smelter reduction cells are
being retroﬁtted in 4 potrooms (66 reduction cells were
retroﬁtted in 2018): over 10% of the smelter’s reduction
cells have been converted to use the new technology
and modern gas scrubbers that have been installed on
3 potlines. Experimental Green Soederberg production
areas are being operated at the Irkutsk, Novokuznetsk
and Volgograd aluminium smelters. In ﬁve potrooms
at KrAZ the gas ducts under the potrooms have been
equipped with state-of-the-art automated pneumatic
impulse cleaners.
The deployment of the Green Soederberg process
reduces emissions of contaminants into the atmosphere
to levels compliant with environmental regulations,
while reducing the consumption of electricity,
signiﬁcantly cutting the amount of work in progress and
increasing the service life of reduction cells.
— In order to reduce electricity consumption per
tonne of output and boost the output of crude
aluminium the reduction amperage was increased
on the fifth potline at IrkAZ. The SCADA system
was retrofitted, new re-designed dispensers were
installed on the automated alumina point feeding
system, and the bag ﬁlters of the gas scrubbers have
been replaced. Tests confirmed that the reduction
cells can operate at an amperage of 332 kA.
Expanding the share of value-added products in total
output
As competition intensiﬁes and customers are making
more stringent metal quality requirements, the
Company launched a number of projects to achievea
competitive edge and maintain its market share:
In 2018, KrAZ completed the construction of a new
casting system for making homogenized billets in
diameters from 8 inches to 18 inches cast using the
Airslip technology, which should provide a competitive
edge to our Company and ensure that we can maintain
our customers. In 2019, work will continue to achieve

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

design capacity at the system (120 thousand tonnes of
product per year).
In April 2018, SAZ commissioned a system for removing
alkaline metals and carbides from aluminium to meet
the demands of leading customers for metal purity and
boost its casthouse’s output of slabs by 20 thousand
tonnes tonnes per year.
KrAZ completed the installation and debugging of
a new PDBF ﬁlter heating system. The implementation
of the project prevented the falling of the output
of casting machines No. 4 and No. 5 during the
replacement of ﬁlters while boosting the overall output
of the casthouse by 3 thousand tonnes of slabs per year.
Environment:
In 2018, the Company received a DNV-GL certiﬁcate
as conﬁrmation that its environmental management
system meets the requirements of ISO 14001-2015.
Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Veriﬁcation of the carbon footprint of the aluminium
offered under the new ALLOW brand:
The Company has for the ﬁrst time veriﬁed the aluminium
it offers customers under the new ALLOW brand. The
veriﬁcation was conducted by the international audit
ﬁrm KPMG. In 2017, ALLOW aluminium made up 77%
of the Company’s total output. All calculations were
carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for
Reporting the Aluminium Carbon Footprint developed
by the International Aluminium Institute and published
in February 2018.
Implementation of the ASI standard
In December 2017, a large-scale project on the
implementation of the Aluminium Stewardship
Initiative (ASI) standard was launched. The ASI standard
began to be implemented at several pilot production
sites: Boksit Timana, UAZ, IrkAZ and the Management
Company. In 2018, the requirements of the standard
were introduced; personnel was trained, the necessary
internal documents were developed and business
processes were modiﬁed to meet the requirements of
the standard. Certiﬁcation is planned for 2019.

Engineering and Construction Division
Below are projects fulﬁlled by production facilities and
branches of the Engineering and Construction Division
(ECD) in 2018 and actions scheduled for 2019:
31

Business Overview

The ECD and the Engineering and Construction Institute
(Siberian Federal University-SFU) arranged modular
professional re-trainings for construction project
managers and experts to enhance their qualiﬁcation.
Four postgraduates with master’s degrees completed
their training in the Institute of Non-Ferrous Metals and
Material Sciences (SFU); and a new group of students
was selected to study ‘Metallurgy (Anodes)’. Eleven
students participated in the ﬁrst higher education
bachelor’s degree program co-ﬁnanced by ECD. In 2018,
the ECD training center in Krasnoyarsk hosted 1,902
people who enhanced their occupational skills.
In 2018, plants and ECD branches implemented joint
equipment reliability plans and signiﬁcantly reduced
downtime by 23% or 16,000 hours as compared to
2017, which, in turn, facilitated the minimization of
production costs and the increase of output.
The following issues were addressed as part of the smelter
electrical equipment reliability improvement plans:
1. In August 2017, ORD-66667/220/10 high-voltage
transformer was installed and tested on the main
stepdown substation 2 at the Bratsk smelter. For
the first time that design was made employing
high-voltage aluminium wiring to ensure a stable
power supply to potrooms 1,2,3 and 4 of the Bratsk
smelter. In 2018, two high-voltage transformers with
the same design were installed at the Bratsk and
Krasnoyarsk smelters. Every year, including 2019,
it is planned to replace two transformers of such a
design at aluminium smelters.
2. In June 2018, the Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk branches
of RUS-Engineering Ltd purchased and commissioned new ChMZAP 70300 low loaders with a
carrying capacity of 160 tonnes to transport transformers.
3. In January 2018, heads of electrotechnical labs
underwent a joint training at the Bratsk center of
competencies delivered by a chief of diagnostics
and trials of BAUR as well as by test departments
of the manufacturer of 9 mobile labs purchased in
December 2017. The labs were purchased to control and diagnose cable lines of up to 10 kV with
non-destructive methods using extremely low frequencies, deﬁning dielectric losses in isolation and
preventing outages. In 2018, there were 781 tests of
HV cable lines, which revealed 6 emergency cables,
where coupling sleeves and sections were replaced.
An action plan was developed and approved to
replace worn-out cable lines following the cabling
tests and analysis. A MES cable diagnostics module
was integrated into SAP R/3 TSRE, which allowed

32

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

analyzing an operation of cable lines in 9 branches
of the company with the use of mobile labs. Final
tests of all HV cable lines are scheduled for 2019.
4. In 2018, a project titled ‘Separation of the needs of
the Sayanogorsk Aluminium Smelter’, designed to
increase power supply reliability, was completed, a
positive expert opinion was received and a tender
procedure was started to purchase the required
equipment. In 2019, it is planned to purchase equipment and carry out construction and assembly works.
5. In 2018, the Bratsk center of competencies
launched a project to increase maintenance efficiency and optimize costs targeting a shorter transformer maintenance time and the use of in-house
resources.
A 500 tonnes multi-purpose mobile LIEBHERR crane
was purchased as part of a vehicle ﬂeet modernization
plan. The crane helped shorten the process equipment
maintenance period at the Achinsk reﬁnery (powered
conveyors, gas scrubbers and sintering furnaces).
In 2017, Achinsk commissioned an automatic moulding
line, which facilitated the supply of good quality castings
to the Company’s smelters at the minimum cash cost.
In 2018, the automatic moulding line cast more than
8,700 tonnes of cast-iron items from various alloys. The
2019 target is to start casting 100% of gas hood sections
for pots.
As concerns pot rebuilds, a pot life cycle of 2,075 days
was reached; the efforts will continue in 2019.
The Bratsk branch started pouring pre-heated castiron into cathode bottom blocks of all pots being
rebuilt in order to reduce voltage drop on the steel
bar-bottom block contact connection by 35 mV and, as
a consequence, to minimize power consumption by
117.3 kWh/t of aluminium.
During 2018 under the modernization plan there were
254 S8BMe/S8Be pots installed at the Krasnoyarsk
smelter; 101 energy-efﬁcient ShPVVe pots and 67
environmentally-friendly S8Ba pots installed at the
Bratsk smelter and 2 RA-167 pots installed in a trial area
of the Novokuznetsk smelter.
In 2018, the Krasnoyarsk pot rebuilding department
developed, manufactured and installed the following
pieces of equipment:
1. a gantry cathode relining and metal structure assembly machine to improve labour conditions,

Business Overview

improve relining and metal structure manufacturing
quality (as a result, costs on purchasing of metal
structures from third party suppliers were reduced),
shorten pot rebuild periods, optimize production
areas and the number of auxiliary equipment;
2. a batching hopper for BROCHOT ramming machine
to improve the quality of operations (to maintain a
controllable set material temperature and to batch
ramming paste automatically) while ramming cathode bottom seams and to avoid a hazardous impact
on the personnel.
It is planned to install these pieces of equipment at
all ECD branches, provided that industrial tests and
operational trials are a success.
In 2018, 42 out of 1,191 pots disconnected for relining
with their life time of up to 36 months, this being the
lowest historical indicator.
In 2018, the Krasnoyarsk branch of RUS-Engineering Ltd
continued to mass produce special self-propelled pot
treatment vehicles as part of the project titled ‘RUSAL
Treatment Vehicles’, which allowed putting aside as
many purchases of such vehicles abroad as possible. In
2018, 43 treatment vehicles were manufactured and put
into operation.
Since the beginning of the project, 173 vehicles have
been put into operation and the design of 34 vehicles
has been developed. The Group has made 52 patent
applications to protect its intellectual property,
including 5 in 2018. A total of 42 patents were obtained
in Russia, including four in 2018. There were 17 selfpropelled vehicles certiﬁed and registered for serial
vehicle production in line with the TR TS 010/2011
Technical Regulation of the Customs Union ‘Re Vehicle
and Equipment Safety’.
One of the main aims of the ‘RUSAL Treatment
Vehicles’ project in 2019 is to design and manufacture
environmentally-friendly local diesel treatment
vehicles to ensure reliable operation with a service life
of at least 15,000 machine-hours.
In 2018, as part of the Metal Structure Manufacturing
Project the Krasnoyarsk branch produced 17,165
tonnes of metal structures and aluminium goods, of
which 9,342 tonnes were ferrous-metal structures and
7,822 tonnes were aluminium articles for the Taishet and
Boguchany aluminium smelters; metal structures were
supplied to the Bratsk and Shelekhov branches to meet
their demand; and metal structures is in progress for
the start-up complex of the Taishet aluminium smelter.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Personnel enhanced their transformer rewinding
skills at the transformer maintenance department
in Krasnoyarsk. Two TDTsNP-50,000/10 rectiﬁer
transformers were repaired.
In 2018, RUSAL Kamensk-Uralsky maintained a ball mill
having replaced a drum made in China (Chaoyang Heavy
Machinery Group) for the ﬁrst time. The plant saved
RUB1.86 million on the ball mill drum as compared
to the cost of purchasing from local manufacturers. In
2018, automatic process control software of all three
production stages was designed and installed as part
of the construction of the ‘Precipitation Substitution
Module’. As a result of the cooperation between RUSAL
Kamensk-Uralsky and the Kamensk-Uralsky branch, the
2018 output targets were exceeded with the output
reaching 910,000 tonnes.
In 2018, the ECD planned to implement 35 environmental
projects with a total budget of USD84 million. It
was resolved to suspend 23 projects amounting to
USD35 million because of the US sanctions against
the Company. Despite this, in 2018, the Company
commenced the construction of gas scrubbers for CJSC
Kremniy in Shelekhov, commenced the uniﬁcation of
sections 1, 2 and 3 of mud disposal area 3 for RUSAL
Kamensk-Uralsky, commenced maintenance on
steam boiler 4 and commenced construction of a new
evaporation train 16 for Friguia Alumina Reﬁnery bauxite
and alumina complex; and also started revamping a gas
scrubber of sintering furnace 6 for RUSAL Achinsk.
A gas scrubber of sintering furnace 7 was maintained
and commissioned at RUSAL Achinsk, together with
equipment of ﬁrst and second process lines at RUSAL
Achinsk (electrical precipitators 1-3, calciners 2 and
3, the mud disposal area, evaporation train 14 and
construction structures); Ploshchad Revolutsii (Square
of Revolution) and Surikov Skver (Surikov Square) were
restored in Krasnoyarsk.
In 2019, it is planned to start construction of an alumina
terminal in Vanino port, construction of a mud disposal
area 1 at the Nikolaev alumina reﬁnery, a reconstruction
of gas scrubbers connected to sintering furnaces 5 and 8
at RUSAL Achinsk, construction of treatment facilities
at Timan Bauxite JSC, to complete maintenance of
steam boiler 4 and construction of evaporation train 16,
and to start maintenance of steam boiler 5 and turbine
4 at Friguia Alumina Reﬁnery.
In 2018, production facilities and branches of ECD
made signiﬁcant efforts to construct facilities of new
aluminium smelters, maintain process equipment
and participate in all environmental projects of the
Company, and all KPIs of the ECD were achieved.

main production processes of the Company’s facilities;
— increasing the volume of treated and used waste
products and their safe disposal;
— replacing and disposing of electrical equipment containing polychlorbiphenyls (PCBs);
— rehabilitating land which has been negatively impacted and assisting in the maintenance of biodiversity;
— creating corporate systems to manage environmental
aspects and risks.

Business Overview

By following this environmental policy and undertaking
to regularly review and update its provisions, the
Company has tasked itself with continuously developing
and improving its environmental management system
and implementing its principles at all production
facilities, including all those which are in operation and
those which are still under construction. In 2017, RUSAL
ran a project to implement ASI standards13 at its pilot
plants to apply international sustainable principles to
the aluminium production chain. The certiﬁcation of
pilot plants is planned in March 2019.
As part of achieving its objectives of continuous
development and improvement of its environmental
management system, the Company pays special attention
to certifying its factories for compliance with ISO 140012015, the international standard for environmental
management systems. All RUSAL’s aluminium smelters
are certiﬁed as ISO 14001-2015 compliant.
The Group has also taken steps to lessen the
environmental impact of its operations and comply
with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Health & Safety: a core priority
RUSAL’s activities to provide safe working conditions for
employees and reduce occupational diseases and injuries
are governed by the corporate Occupational Health
and Safety Policy. The Company’s efforts are integrated
into the Occupational Health and Safety Management
System, which is one of the crucial management systems
in RUSAL’s business.
The Company has the following health and safety
objectives:
— To strive for zero injuries, zero emergencies and zero
ﬁres;
— To ensure the compliance of equipment and production processes with legal and regulatory requirements for occupational health, industrial and ﬁre
safety;
— To ensure personnel safety and health in the workplace and improve workplace environment on an
ongoing basis in order to increase the level of safety;
and
— To prevent occupational diseases.
The Occupational Health and Safety Management
System is deployed at every production facility. It
includes a risk management system, emergency response

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

plans, budgeting of health and safety measures, personnel
training based on national and corporate requirements,
and a corporate e-learning system. Occupational
health and ﬁre safety measures are ﬁnanced strictly on
a timely basis to provide for identiﬁcation of hazards
and development of procedures to improve working
conditions.
RUSAL pays special attention to establishing
a constructive dialogue with state authorities and
employees, business partners, the general public and
expert organizations to jointly resolve health and safety
issues. For this purpose, the Company’s experts and
managers participate in the legislative process through
the Occupational Health, Safety and Environmental
Committee of the Russian Union of Industrialists and
Entrepreneurs, Russian Duma committees, federal
ministries and services, the Russian Chamber of Industry
and Commerce, the Russian Mining Trade Union, the
Russian Association of Mining Industrialists, and other
non-proﬁt organizations and partnerships.
The universally accepted health and safety management
systems is a system based on the OHSAS 18001:2007
international standard. Regular audits of this system at
RUSAL are strengthened by numerous regular internal
audits, which qualitatively and quantitatively assess
key elements of the system, identify deﬁciencies and
develop effective corrective measures to manage risks
and prevent failures and injuries. According to 2018 data,
the LTAFR (Lost Time Accident Frequency Rate) was
0.16 which is a slight increase compared to 2017 (0.15),
but is considerably less than the global average for the
aluminium industry in 2017 (0.38).
In total, 50 internal audits of health and safety
management systems were carried out at the Company’s
sites. Det Norske Veritas held re-certiﬁcation audits at
the production facilities and the Company’s head ofﬁce,
which conﬁrmed the health and safety management
systems’ compliance with the requirements of OHSAS
18001:2007.
A sustainable player, engaged in all relevant industry
sustainability initiatives
Primary aluminium production leads to a high volume of
GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions. The main sources of
GHG emissions are carbon anodes consumption due to
carbon oxidation, perﬂuorocarbon emissions and indirect
GHG emissions related to the generation of power

13 The ASI Performance and Chain of Custody Standards have been developed and designed to be globally applied, and throughout the aluminium value chain to enable the aluminium
industry to demonstrate responsibility and provide independent and credible assurance of performance, reinforce and promote consumer and stakeholder conﬁdence in aluminium
products, reduce reputational risks concerning aluminium and aluminium industry players; and address the expressed needs by downstream industrial users and consumers for responsible sourcing of aluminium. Further details can be obtained at https://aluminium-stewardship.org/.

Business Overview

consumed. Indirect emissions can be much higher than
direct emissions from aluminium smelting and can be
up to 5-10 times more in case of power generation from
coal. The current average worldwide level of direct and
non-direct energy emissions of aluminium production is
12.314 tCO2eq/tAl. 2017 RUSAL level was 2.8 tCO2eq/tAl.
In 2007, the Company signed a memorandum of
understanding with the United Nations Development
Program. The aim of the memorandum is to implement
measures to minimize the Group’s impact on climate
change, by reducing the Group’s greenhouse gas
emissions. The Group is actively participating in the
International Aluminium Institute’s activities related to
targeting the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and
energy efﬁciency. The Group has achieved signiﬁcant
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. For instance,
the Group’s aluminium smelters reduced speciﬁc
greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 by 61% compared to
1990 emissions levels.
To perform more accurate calculations, the Company has
developed a number of methodologies for determining
greenhouse gas emissions which take into account
the features of the Company’s production facilities.
The methodologies take into account the features
of production facilities of RUSAL. An independent
international veriﬁcation body, BSI and KPMG have
conﬁrmed that our methodologies comply with the
requirements of national and international standards
and regulations. The Company ﬁrst veriﬁed its ALLOW
brand in 2018 with the help of the international auditor
KPMG. In 2017, 77% of the Company’s output was
attributed to this brand. The computations followed the
methodology contained in the International Aluminium
Institute’s carbon footprint reporting guidelines
published in February 2018.
The Company has developed programs to achieve
the speciﬁc direct GHG emissions reduction strategic
goals at aluminium smelters and alumina reﬁneries by
15% and 10%, respectively, by 2025 compared to 2014.
(In 2017 aluminium smelters reduced speciﬁc direct
GHG emissions by 3.7% and alumina reﬁneries by 4%
compared to 2014).
Since 2017, the Company has applied the internal
price of carbon (USD20 per tonne of CO2eq) when
developing new projects.
In 2016, UC RUSAL initiated a project for the
development of international guidelines at the
International Aluminium Institute (IAI), aimed at the

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

standardization of approaches for aluminium carbon
footprint reporting. The Aluminium Carbon Footprint
Technical Support Document was developed and
approved by the IAI board of directors in October 2017,
and ofﬁcially published by IAI in February 2018. RUSAL
will use this document as a guideline for reporting its
own carbon footprint internally and externally. It will
allow the Company to report comparable ﬁgures to
customers and other interested parties.
RUSAL is actively participating in the updating of the
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas
Inventories for Aluminium industry. The Final Draft
Guidelines has been issued and the updated guidelines
shall be approved in May 2019.
In 2016, the Company joined Aluminium Stewardship
Initiative (ASI). ASI is a global, multi-stakeholder, nonproﬁt standards setting and certiﬁcation organization.
It is the result of producers, users and stakeholders
in the aluminium value chain coming together with
a commitment to maximizing the contribution of
aluminium to a sustainable society. ASI’s objectives are:
— deﬁne globally applicable standards for sustainability performance and material chain-of-custody for
the aluminium value chain;
— promote measurable and continual improvements
in the key environmental, social and governance impacts of aluminium production, use and recycling;
— develop a credible assurance and certiﬁcation system that both mitigates the risks of non-conformity
with ASI standards and minimizes barriers to broad
scale implementation.
RUSAL participated in the COP24 international Climate Change Conference (held at Katowice, Poland on
2-14 December 2018), where it contributed to the agenda of the Russian pavilion – a place for presentations,
expert discussions of government ofﬁcials, NGOs as
well as Russian and foreign scientiﬁc and business communities. On 11 December, the Russian pavilion hosted
a Low Carbon Material Day, when Mr. Evgenii Nikitin,
CEO of RUSAL, and other representatives of the Company and the Climate Partnership of Russia delivered
their speeches. Mr. Nikitin spoke of the Company’s climate KPIs and innovations aimed at reducing negative
environmental impacts. In addition, environmental education and environmental voluntary work undertaken
by the Company were highlighted.

Business Overview

Further, RUSAL took an active part in preparing the
“Green Mosaic of Russia” exhibition at the conference
and a round table discussion titled “Russian Investments into a Low GHG Emission Development”.
RUSAL submits regular GHG emission reports from its
productions to the Russian Meteorological Ofﬁce to
register emissions in the National Cadastre of Anthropogenic Emissions from Sources and Absorption by
GHG sinks. In 2018, RUSAL participated in the review
of Russian reports in relation to the The United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
and made a detailed presentation to an international
expert team on the policy and actions of the Company,
a disclosure of carbon reporting in compliance with international standards, as well as on environmental education and trainings.
In 2018, a newly formed ICC Russia Commission on Climate Change Economy and Sustainability commenced
operation. RUSAL chaired the commission, which
formulated recommendations to business regarding
‘green’ ﬁnancing, carbon regulation, energy efﬁciency,
sustainability and a transition to a low-carbon economy.
In light of this conference, in November 2018, RUSAL
arranged a round table titled ‘Green Technologies in
Russia: Reality and Prospects’, where RUSAL made
a key presentation on its development and implementation of ‘green’ technologies.
RUSAL took an active part in a publication of a report
by the Carbon-pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC) on
the use of carbon-pricing to address climate risks and
new opportunities through the example of the construction industry value chain. The published information included RUSAL’s experience in implementing
an internal carbon price and commercialising ALLOW,
a low-carbon aluminium brand15.

Business Overview

In 2018, RUSAL implemented a large project of creating
modern, comfortable and safe public spaces for residents
and tourists in the historic center of Krasnoyarsk. The
project started from a survey and analysis of existing
public places, then the new concept of planning and
functionality was developed for the city center area
including Revolution square, Surikov garden and the
city’s Central Park, and the new architectural design for
the area was prepared and implemented. In practical
stage, the newer small architectural objects were set
up, lighting and landscaping arranged. As a result, the
renovated area became the favorite place for walks
with the city residents and one of the city sights for the
tourists. Over a hundred thousand people have visited
renovated area during weekends and vacations. By
implementing this project, the Company shared with the
regional authorities a modern approach for renovation of
public spaces in Krasnoyarsk.
The goal of the "Helping is easy program" is to foster
social activity in the local communities, get the
Company’s personnel involved in corporate social and
environmental activities, build partnership with NGOs,
businesses and local government bodies.
The Company maintains the following activities within
the program:
— Development and launch of complex volunteer
program focused at different groups of stakeholders: employees, local communities, NGOs;
— Formation of volunteering eco-system within the
local communities to provide sustainability of volunteer activities;
— Support of volunteer teams by grant giving contest
“Helping is easy”;
— Development and launch of educational courses for
volunteers.
The "Helping is easy program" is operated since 2014
and more than 5,000 partner organizations support
the Company’s volunteering projects. The Company
established the National Council for Corporate
Volunteering to share best practices; it unites over
30 major Russian companies and has regional groups in
12 regions of Russia. Three thousand employees annually
support the Company’s volunteering projects. During the
past eight years, 38 thousand volunteers participated in
RUSAL volunteering programs such as “The Yenisei Day”,
“Green Wave” and the New Year charitable marathon.
250 thousand of local residents received assistance from
volunteer teams.

The mentioned above “Yenisei Day” is a large-scale
project of environmental volunteering implemented
since 2011 in the Krasnoyarsk Territory and republics
of Khakassia and Tyva with the goal of cleaning the
coastal zone of the Yenisei River. During the period
of the project implementation, the Company carried
out 300 environmental activities and involved
75,000 volunteers who collected and removed 10
tonnes of garbage from the riverbanks and released
5,000 juvenile ﬁshes into the river. The “Yenisei Day” has
become a well-recognized regional tradition.
In the area of sports and healthy living the Company
has developed the “Mounting the Skies Everyone!”
project in partnership with En+ Group and the Russia’s
Ski Federation since 2016. The project serves the goal to
promote a healthy lifestyle and engage employees and
local residents in cross-country skiing in the regions
and cities where the Company operates. Within the
framework of the project RUSAL set up partnerships
with regional sports administrations and cross-country
skiing federations, provided help to the junior ski teams
with 940 units of the skiing equipment, supported the
preparation and launch of the educational courses
completed by 402 skiing coaches who work with smaller
children and junior teams. The Company carried out
mass sports events and activities, such as 15 mass ski
festivals attended by 52,000 local residents and the CUP
Competitions for more than 1,900 junior athletes. In 2018,
RUSAL developed and launched the online distance
learning platform to spread the project’s educational
course; supported the development and launch into
pilot production in Russia of snow-sealing machines
for rolling tracks for cross-country skiing. The machines
will be produced and delivered to the regions, where the
Company operates.

Business Overview

RUSAL continued provision of good health services for
the employees and local residents not only in Russia
but also in distant countries of operation, particularly in
the Republic of Guinea where the Company alongside
with the local government continued struggle against
severe infections. This emergent work started in order
to prevent the outbreak and spread of the Ebola virus
in Guinea and Africa. Since 2014, the Company in joint
action with the Russian government has provided the
modern anti-epidemic equipment and services, set
up and provided operation of the Clinical Diagnostic
Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, as well as
opened the modern laboratory complex for combating
dangerous infectious diseases, delivered vaccine against
Ebola developed in Russia. Due to taken measures,
the Clinical Diagnostic Center successfully treated
62.5% of its patients with a conﬁrmed diagnosis of
Ebola fever, which became the highest percentage of
recovering patients during the Ebola outbreak in Guinea;
2,000 local residents have passed anti-Ebola vaccination.
The launch of the new laboratory complex has made
possible a quickly detection of severely dangerous
infections, upgraded the national sanitation security in
Guinea and signiﬁcantly diminished risks of spread of
severe infections in the future.

MANAGEMENT
DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

Overview of Trends in the Aluminium
Industry and Business Environment
Highlights for the full year 2018
— Global aluminium demand is likely to increase in
2019 now that the trade wars and supply side shocks
of 2018 have subsided. Additionally, consumers
have adjusted their expectations after the shocks of
late 2018, expecting markets outside of China to be
in heavy deﬁcit in 2019. Therefore, global aluminium
demand is expected to rise by 3.7% year-on-year in
2019 to 68 million tonnes vs 3.6% growth in 2018
year-on-year to 65.6 million tonnes.
— Global aluminium supply was unchanged by 0.5%
year-on-year to 64.1 million tonnes in 2018 after 7%
rise year-on-year in 2017. Global supply excluding
China, grew by 1.8% to 27.7 million tonnes, while
Chinese supply contracted by 0.6% to 36.4 million
tonnes.
— In China production fell by more than 3 million
tonnes between August and December 2018 as
a result of low aluminium prices and tight environmental regulations.
— Still around 60% of Chinese aluminium smelting
production and 50% of the ROW is struggling due
to high power and alumina prices.
— Aluminium stocks at the LME warehouses dropped
by 175 thousand tonnes to 926 thousand tonnes
between January to mid-October 2018 – the lowest
levels since December 2007. However, by the end
of 2018 stocks rebounded to 1,273 thousand tonnes.
January 2019 has seen a signiﬁcant increase in LME
cancelled warrants to 755 thousand tonnes, the
lowest it has been in years.
Global aluminium
During 4Q 2018, the aluminium price along with the
whole LME metals’ market was affected by the investor
sell-off that resulted from rising trade tensions between
the US and China. Many market participants believe this
could continue to negatively impact future economic
growth and industrial activity.

42

Aluminium demand and premiums
Global aluminium demand is expected to recover
in 2019 after the trade wars and supply shocks that occurred in the second half of 2018. Consumers will gradually adapt to the new reality as markets outside of China remain in heavy deﬁcit, economic activity grows and
subsequently diminishes supply risks. As such, global
aluminium demand is expected to rise by 3.7% yearon-year in 2019 to 68 million tonnes vs 3.6% growth in
2018 year-on-year to 65.6 million tonnes.
Russian economic growth slowed at the end of 2018
but GDP still increased by an estimated 1.8%. Industrial production index growth amounted to 2.9% of
GDP. Investment in ﬁxed Russian assets rose after the
recession by 3.0%. This was fueled by the increase in
the construction industry since 3Q 2018. This trend is
expected to continue in 2019 which will help maintain
a high demand for aluminium from the building materials industry, as well as the energy transfer sector. Primary aluminium demand in Russia and CIS countries
grew by 9.9% to 1.1 million tonnes (including 0.9 million
tonnes in Russia) in 2018 and is expected to rise to 1.21.25 million tonnes in 2019.
Global and regional headwinds weighed on Europe’s
economy testing its resilience in 2018. The US-China
trade war and the risk of a no-deal Brexit continue to
drag down business conﬁdence in January. After a strong
start to 2018, the economies of the EU28 appeared to
have lost signiﬁcant momentum in the second half of
the year but the year ended at a reasonable growth of
1.5% in 4Q 2018.
Output in the construction industry increased all
throughout 2018 with Germany’s construction PMI hitting the seven-month high (53.3) in December. It was
the upturn in homebuilding demand that drove the
steepest rise in total industry activity.
The automotive sector endured disruption in 2018 as
manufacturers struggled to address the car certiﬁcation and registration bottlenecks that resulted from the
implementation of the Worldwide Harmonised Light
Vehicle Test Procedure (“WLTP”) for emissions. The

Management Discussion and Analysis

changeover to the WLTP test cycle constrained production and output slumped in the largest country-producers by 4.7% in the ﬁrst nine months of 2018. In addition,
the Section 232 investigation on auto sector tariffs is
ongoing and presents risk to vehicle production in 2019.
Aluminium growth remained ahead of car manufacturing growth as primary aluminium demand rose by 2.2%
up to 9.6 million tonnes in Europe (including Turkey but
excluding Russia).
North America witnessed strong growth in 2018, with
economic and industrial activity accelerating sharply.
GDP rose by an estimated 2.8%. Industrial production
expanded at its fastest pace for several years in September and climbed at an estimated rate of 3.4% in 2018.
Although vehicle production inched down by 0.5%,
aluminium demand remained strong. Construction was
relatively strong with the number of new builds growing
by nearly 6% in January to October 2018. Overall primary aluminium demand in North America expanded
by 1.6% to 6.9 million tonnes.
Favourable domestic conditions have been supporting
Japan’s economic expansion. GDP increased by 0.8% in
2018 year-on-year. Whilst industrial production grew by
0.9%, it should be noted that this is below last year’s
level due to weather-related problems in 1Q 2018 and
3Q 2018. Despite a strong outlook for commercial and
infrastructure spending ahead of the Olympics, a slowdown in new housing developments tempered overall
activity in the construction sector. At the same time, automotive production remained at the same level in the
ﬁrst eleven months of the year.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

industrial sector output climbed at an estimated 5.3%.
Those factors combined drove aluminium primary demand growth of 3.5% in 2018 to 2.2 million tonnes.
The Chinese economy grew at 6.6% year-on-year in
2018, however, the global instability and the trading
conﬂict with the US deteriorated production activity
with Cauxin PMI declining below the 50 level by end
of 2018. Other sectors had a more mixed picture: automotive production declined by 4.2%; FAI investments
grew by 5.9% and ﬂoor construction grew by 5.2% of in
2018 year-on-year. Aluminium demand was up by 4.6%
year-on-year to 35.8 million tonnes but is estimated to
accelerate to 5.1% in 2019 year-on-year to 37.6 million
tonnes as a result of planned credit and capital stimulus
by the Government.
The aluminium premiums were highly volatile in 2018
as a result of different market challenges such as the introduction of import duty in the U.S. , OFAC Sanctions
against RUSAL and several interruptions at smelters.
Overall, the premiums grew by 9-10% on a comparable
basis in 2018 except premiums in Japan. In the second
half of 2018, the premiums trended down, mainly due to
market backwardation that contributed to a liquidation
of traders stocks. Asian premiums were affected by rising Chinese aluminium exports.

The ASEAN region saw a modest slowdown in growth
in 2018, although primary aluminium demand resisted
this trend. Continued investment in semis capacity has
enabled the overperformance of the aluminium industry compared to industrial growth. As a result, aluminium primary demand in Asia (ex China and India) rose by
1.6% to 6.6 million tonnes in 2018.
The Indian economy expanded at a brisk rate of 7.4% in
2018, up from 6.2% in 2017 when demand was hindered
by policy disruptions. Output growth from the construction sector increased by 8.1% on a yearly basis, whereas

43

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Aluminium supply and stocks
Global aluminium supply was relatively unchanged
only experiencing 0.5% growth year-on-year to 64.1
million tonnes in 2018 after 7% raise in 2017 year-onyear. Globally, excluding China, supply grew by 1.8% to
27.7 million tonnes, while Chinese supply contracted
36.4 million tonnes. The availability of aluminium scrap
may also increase in 2019 as scrap prices are expected
to rise and demand to increase.
Aluminium production outside China was ﬂat in 2018
at 27.6 million tonnes and 50% of aluminium productions outside of China operated at a loss. This is likely
to limit potential restarts and will further increase the
risk of supply disruptions. Aluminium stocks at the
LME warehouses dropped by 175 thousand tonnes to
926 thousand tonnes during January to mid-October
2018, the lowest since December 2007. By the end of
2018 stocks rebounded to 1,273 thousand tonnes. January 2019 has seen a signiﬁcant increase in LME cancelled
warrants to 755 thousand tonnes, a multi-year low.
In China, production fell by more than 3 million tonnes
from August to December 2018 as a result of low aluminium prices and tight environmental regulation.
Nonetheless around 60% of Chinese aluminium smelting production is struggling due to high power and
alumina prices. Chinese regional stocks declined by
0.5 million tonnes year-on-year to 1.33 million tonnes
at the end of 2018 and returned to an average monthly
level of 2018.

44

Chinese aluminium exports increased by 23.4% to
5.23 million tonnes. In 2019 Chinese exports will face
challenges and are expected to decline. Due to lower
arbitrage, a fall in inventories/production and the new
stimulation program that are expected to be introduced
by the Chinese Government to signiﬁcantly improve
domestic aluminium balance.

RUSAL’s aluminium production results
The Group’s primary aluminium production for the year
ended 31 December 2018 demonstrates slight increase
(+1.2% year-on-year) as compared to the previous year
and totaled 3,753 thousand tonnes.
Production of VAP went down (-16.4% year-on-year)
from 1,885 thousand tonnes in 2017 to 1,575 thousand
tonnes in 2018, with the share of VAP decreasing from
50.8% to 42.0 % in 2018.

Mechanization and automation:
— The Engineering and manufacturing of process
equipment of the Company’s own production were
continued in frames of the Project RUSAL Pot
tending machines (PROM) in order to improve labor
conditions of operators and eliminate physically
demanding operations. 173 units of equipment have
been manufactured since 2013, 43 of them in 2018.
— In order to improve labor conditions in anode
production area RUSAL Krasnoyarsk equipped
8 cranes with a remote control (working station
of the operator is now located not in the area of
operation, but in the administration room); RUSAL
Bratsk continues the project for the substitution
of pot operators’ handwork by the machinery – in
2018 2 multifunctional cranes have been commissioned after the overhaul; the works for installation
of remote radio-control at rare-used cranes are in
progress.
— The Company implements the project “end-toend automation” aimed at improvement of production management system. In 2018, in frames of the
project RUSAL Sayanogorsk opened pilot areas for
modernization of network infrastructure, development of system for technical record-keeping and
telemetry of power facilities, implementation of
a modern MES-system replacing local process
automated working stations. RUSAL Krasnoyarsk,
RUSAL Sayanogorsk and RUSAL Bratsk are implementing a casting data system. A common technological portal was created for the Aluminium
Division powered by modern business analysis
products. The update of automatic process control
system of the main production areas is in progress:
in 2018 work has been completed in 2 pot rooms,
started in another 6 pot rooms. Automatic process
control systems have been amended in 3 areas of
the electrode production in RUSAL Sayanogorsk.

Health, safety, environment (HSE):
— One of priorities of sustainable development of the
Company is the ensuring of environmental safety.
The strategy of environmental safety of the production plant of the Aluminium Division is aimed at
modernization of production by implementation
of the best available process technology. In pursuance of these strategical goals RUSAL Krasnoyarsk,
RUSAL Bratsk, Branch of RUSAL Bratsk in Shelekhov and RUSAL Novokuznetsk in 2018 continued
the transition of reduction area to Green Soderberg
technology. RUSAL Novokuznetsk expands the
pilot area and installs the pots operated with prebaked anodes. Aluminium Division (RUSAL Krasnoyarsk, RUSAL Bratsk, Branch of RUSAL Bratsk in
Shelekhov and RUSAL Novokuznetsk) modernizes
the existing Fume Treatment Centers and installs
new high efﬁcient Dry gas treatment units of its
own technology. To insure safe waste disposal
RUSAL Sayanogorsk completed the construction
and commissioning of the ﬁrst start-up complex
of the second stage of the landﬁll deposit of solid
household waste and the second area of industrial
waste, RUSAL Bratsk completed the reconstruction of Bauxite residue disposal area. More than
USD33 million were invested into environmental
projects in 2018.

All production plants of Aluminium Division conﬁrmed
in 2018 the compliance with the ISO4001, environmental management system certiﬁcate.
Certiﬁed production plants of Aluminium Division
obtained in 2018 the conﬁrmation of compliance with
OHSAS 18001 requirements.

Alumina production results
RUSAL’s total attributable alumina output was
7,774 thousand tonnes in 2018 and 7,773 thousand
tonnes in 2017. In spite of the fact that the production
volumes of Achinsk Alumina Reﬁnery, Windalco and
Aughinish Alumina Reﬁnery declined, the launch of
Friguia made it possible to maintain the production volume at the level of 2017.
Calculated based on the pro rata share of the Company’s (and its subsidiaries’) ownership in corresponding
alumina reﬁneries.

Bauxite production results
RUSAL’s total attributable bauxite output17 was
13,847 thousand tonnes in 2018, as compared to
11,645 thousand tonnes in 2017. The decrease in bauxite production at Windalco occured because of the
poor contractors’ ﬂeet condition. The stabilization
of rail transportation at CBK (the acquisition of three
additional locomotives and new wagons) after the accidents in October 2016 and April 2017 allowed to increase the production volumes and export of bauxite
in 2018. In 2018 haulage equipment renovation project was ﬁnished at BCGI which made it possible to
signiﬁcantly increase production volumes in relation
to 2017. The additional 1,560 thousand tonnes to 2017
were obtained as a result of the launch of Friguia after the stop and the new Dian-Dian mine.

17 Bauxite output data was:
•

calculated based on pro-rata share of the Company’s ownership in corresponding bauxite mines and mining complexes. The total production of the Company’s fully consolidated
subsidiary, Bauxite Company of Guyana Inc. , is included in the production ﬁgures, notwithstanding that minority interests in each of these subsidiaries are held by third parties.

•

reported as wet weight (including moisture).

The new Downstream division was established by the
Company in February 2018 to develop and improve the
efﬁciency of producing value-added products from aluminium and aluminium-based alloys. The new Division
has brought together the packaging materials, powder
metallurgy and wheel producing facilities, as well as the
secondary alloys production.

The decrease of the production volume of nepheline
mine in 2018 by 38 thousand tonnes compared to
2017 or (0.9%) is largely explained by the mining works

The increase in the production volumes is explained
by successfully implemented set of measures aimed at
increasing the productivity, including the time losses
of inefﬁcient manufacturing processes, reducing the
internal rejection rate and increasing the general efﬁciency of the production. The extra volume of the pro-

duced products was successfully sold to the consumers
in line with increasing demand for the SKAD brand in

Management Discussion and Analysis

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Silicon production

New Projects Directorate

2018 output is at the level of 2017. Slight deviation in
2018 is mainly due to the difference in the schedule
of maintenance works for the key equipment and cancellation of restart of ore-thermal furnace No.2 after
overhaul (Kremny Shelekhov) due to decline in RUSAL
silicon own needs.

Volkhov aluminium smelter: in 2018 the Company considered the possibility to start the production of automotive
components in the plant facilities involving foreign partners specialized in this ﬁeld. However, foreign companies
are not open for cooperation under current conditions.
Decision was taken and agreements were reached regarding the sale of asset complex of VAZ to АО METACHIM.
The transaction is supposed to be completed in 2019.

Actions aimed at improvement of quality of produced
silicon in cooperation with OOO RUSAL ETC were in
progress in 2018. The reﬁning process technology was
adjusted for Kremny Ural, 100% reﬁnement was implemented in 2 kilns.
Construction and commissioning of GTC (Kremny Ural)
was completed. GTC is now in industrial pilot operation.
Project documentation for construction of GTC-1,2 for
Kremny Shelekhov received a positive nonstate expert
review. Civil and installation works are in progress.

Aluminium production results
The New Projects Directorate comprises the Nadvoitsy
aluminium smelter, the aluminium section of the Ural
smelter (all in Russia), ALSCON (Nigeria).
In 2018, there were no major changes in the status of
UAZ and ALSCON aluminium productions shut down
in 2013.

Powders

Nadvoitsy aluminium smelter: the smelter is completely mothballed.

In order to increase the capacity utilization rate and improve the efﬁciency of business, the SUAL PM Krasnoturyinsk Branch stopped its operation and the production was moved from there to free powder metallurgy
capacities of Volgograd and Shelekhov OOO SUAL PM.

In August 2018, the decision was taken to completely
shut down the production (1/2 of the pot room 4 was operated before) followed by mothballing of the smelter.
The production amounted to 6 thousand tonnes in
2018 showing a decrease of 50% compared to 2017.

Secondary alloys

Downstream projects

The reduction of the production output is related to
stopping the commercial scrap-based alloy production
because of its being unproﬁtable and also because of a
substantial shrinking of the sales market (this product
was export-oriented).

One of the key activities of the Directorate for new
projects is the search for, development and implementation of projects aimed to establish new productions in
order to increase consumption of aluminium and alloys
in downstream and other sectors. The key facilities for
implementation of new projects are mothballed plants:

In 2018, the Company decided to mothball its RUSAL
RESAL capacities and to move dross processing to
the third parties. Out of 14,313 thousand tonnes of
secondary metal, 5.5 thousand tonnes were produced at
the third parties’ facilities.

54

— Project: Production of aluminium radiators for
household use is in progress in the facilities of
NAZ. The project implementation goes in a JV
with ELSO Group of companies (50/50). The new
production plant is the resident of a Priority Social
and Economic Development Area. Civil works are
completed. Certiﬁcates of compliance for manufactured goods GOST 31311-2005 were obtained.
The production plant continuously improves the
process technology and trains the personnel in
frames of the industrial pilot operation. The plan is
supposed to start-up the production in 1Q 2019.

Management Discussion and Analysis

— OOO Bogoslovskiy kabelniy zavod (BKZ) was
founded in December 2016. It was a JV for production of cables and wires in Krasnoturyinsk. BKZ became the resident of a Priority Social and Economic
Development Area in 2017.
— The production of ﬂexible cable semis (wire, multiwire strand, cores of different cross-sections)
was launched in August-December 2017. In 2018
the production involved 298 tonnes of aluminium.
In 4Q 2018 the plant completed the restauration of
the workshop No. 2, its main production area.
— In progress:
— assembly of an armouring machine in the workshop No.2;
— delivery of a bow type skip stranding machine;
— preparation for dispatch: extrusion cable sheathing line and a snake-type strander;
— manufacturing of second armouring machine and
a testing station.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The launch of production of wire products is scheduled
for the 1H of 2019.
Coal production results
The aggregate coal production attributable to the Company’s 50% share in JV Bogatyr Coal LLP increased by
11% to 22,433 thousand tonnes in 2018, as compared to
20,204 thousand tonnes in 2017. The increase in volume
in 2018 as compared to 2017 was due to increased sales
of coal to Kazakh customers resulting from increased
regional demand.
Transportation results
The products transported by JV LLP Bogatyr Trans, in
which the Company has a 50% share, decreased by 7.2%
to 5,773 thousand tonnes in 2018 from 6,222 thousand
tonnes in 2017 due to an decrease in demand in the Russian Federation with the preservation of the structure.

Management Discussion and Analysis

Total cost of sales increased by USD263 million, or 3.7%,
to USD7,446 million in 2018, as compared to USD7,183
million in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by an
increase in the cost of alumina, transportation tariffs
and other raw material costs in 2018 that was partially
compensated by the lower volumes of primary aluminium and alloys sold and depreciation of Russian Ruble
against US dollar between the comparable periods.
The cost of alumina increased by 20.5% in 2018 compared to the previous year, primarily as a result of an
increase in alumina purchase prices between the comparable periods.
The cost of bauxite increased by 7.1% to USD495 million in 2018 compared to USD462 million in 2017, primarily due to the increase in bauxite purchase prices
between the periods.
The cost of raw materials (other than alumina and bauxite) and other costs increased by 8.1% in 2018 compared
to the previous year, due to a rising raw materials purchase price (prices for raw petroleum coke increased by
35.6%, pitch by 17.6%, anode blocks by 16.7%, caustic
soda by 11.1%).

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Energy costs were almost ﬂat between the comparable
periods.
The ﬁnish goods mainly consist of primary aluminium
and alloys (app. 95%). The dynamic of change between
the reporting periods was driven by the ﬂuctuations of
primary aluminium and alloys physical inventory between the reporting dates: 40.7% increase in 2018 as
compared to 26.6% increase in 2017.
Distribution, administrative and other expenses
Distribution expenses increased by 3.6% to
USD462 million in 2018, compared to USD446 million
in 2017, primarily due to the increase in transportation
tariffs partially compensated by depreciation of the
Russian Ruble against the US Dollar between the periods.
Administrative expenses in the amount USD629 million, which include personnel costs, were almost ﬂat
in 2018 compared to 2017.
Gross profit
As a result of the foregoing factors, RUSAL reported
a gross proﬁt of USD2,834 million for the year ended
31 December 2018 as compared to USD2,786 million
for the previous period, representing gross margins of
the periods of 27.6% and 27.9%, respectively.

Management Discussion and Analysis

Finance income increased by USD182 million, or
866.7% to USD203 million in 2018 compared to
USD21 million for the same period of 2017 primarily
due to the net proﬁt from change in fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments for 2018 as compared to
signiﬁcant net loss on this item for 2017.
Finance expenses decreased by USD190 million or
by 21.7% to USD686 million in 2018 as compared to
USD876 million for the corresponding period of 2017,
primarily due to the reason described above as well
as 14.3% decrease of interest expense and other bank
charges between the comparable periods following the
Company’s successful efforts on improvement of the
debt proﬁle and interest rate margins.
The Company’s share in proﬁts of associates for the
years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017 amounted
to USD885 million and USD529 million, respectively.
Share in results of associates in both periods resulted
primarily from the proﬁt from the Company’s investment in Norilsk Nickel.
The market value of the investment in Norilsk Nickel at
31 December 2018 was USD8,286 million as compared
to USD8,294 million as at 31 December 2017.
Share of proﬁts of joint ventures was USD70 million

An internship program dubbed “New Generation” was
launched in 2017 as a part of the external talent pool
development. The program mainly aims to rejuvenate
the Company’s workforce by attracting young specialists with a high potential. Participants were selected
from among the best graduates of the target educational institutions, with high average marks (at least 4.5 for
white-collar personnel), English language skills, readiness to relocation etc. For each intern, a mentor is appointed who then develops an individual development
plan and helps the intern adapt to a new environment,
set and achieve professional goals. Internship lasts for
6 months, during which participants tackle interesting and complicated projects and then defend them in
front of their department and the head of HR. Provided
the defence was successful, a decision may be made to
offer full-time employment. In 2018, the program attracted 145 participants, and over 80% of them have
since become RUSAL’s employees. For the next year,
the plan is to admit over 150 new interns.
In 2018, the Company continued the implementation of
the “RUSAL Laboratory” project. During the year, Laboratories were opened at the Siberian Federal University
and at the Siberian State Industrial University. Laboratories at the Volgograd State Technical University and
the National research Irkutsk state technical University
are also preparing for the unveiling. Furthermore, career
centers, where pupils are intensively preparing for the
Uniﬁed State Examination in the specialized RUSAL
disciplines, were opened in these Laboratories.
In order to increase the prestige of the metallurgical
and mining professions, RUSAL opened ofﬁces in the
Siberian Federal University and at the Siberian State
Industrial University for the application period. RUSAL
representatives advised pupils and their parents on
demanded in the aluminium industry specialities and
training areas.

Business risks
In order to reduce the negative effects of potential
dangers and to ensure stable and sustainable business
development, the Company pays particular attention to
building an effective risk management system.
Risk management is a responsibility of the risk management group created by the Board as a part of the
Directorate for Control. The main internal documents
governing activity in this area are:

Monitoring, reporting and performance
assessment of the risk management system
The Directorate for Control regularly reports on its activities to the Board and Audit Committee. As part of
these reports, the Directorate for Control provides information on the risk management system, the results
of preparing Risk Maps, new risks, and the mitigation of
various types of risks.
The Audit Committee oversees how competently and
adversely management monitors compliance with the
Company’s risk management policies and procedures.
Based on the reporting submitted, the Audit Committee
and the Board review the Company’s risk proﬁle and the
results of its risk management programs on a quarterly
and annual basis respectively.
In 2018, the Company identiﬁed the following risks
which affect its business:
1. The Group operates in a cyclical industry that has
recently experienced price and demand volatility,
which has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the Group’s performance and
ﬁnancial results.
2. The Group’s competitive position in the global aluminium industry is highly dependent on the continued access to inexpensive and uninterrupted electricity supply, in particular, long-term contracts for
such electricity. Increased electricity prices, as well as

ﬁnancial condition and the results of operations.
3. The Group depends on the provision of uninterrupted transportation services and access to infrastructure for the transportation of its materials and
end products across signiﬁcant distances which is
outside of the Company’s control, and the prices for
such services (particularly rail tariffs) could increase.
4. The terms of the credit facility agreements impose
certain limits on the Group’s capital expenditure
and the payment of dividends. Failure by the Group
to comply with the terms and conditions of these
agreements may materially and adversely affect the
Group and its Shareholders.
5. The Group is exposed to foreign currency ﬂuctuations which may affect its ﬁnancial results.
6. En+ is able to inﬂuence the outcome of important
decisions relating to the Group’s business, which
includes transactions with certain related parties.
7. The Group depends on the services of the key senior management personnel.

Management Discussion and Analysis

8. Adverse media speculation, claims and other public
statements could materially and adversely affect
the value of the Shares.
9. The Group’s business may be affected by labor disruptions, shortages of skilled labor and labor costs
inﬂation.
10.The Group relies on third-party suppliers for certain materials.
11. Equipment failures or other difﬁculties may result
in production curtailments or shutdowns.
12. The Group is subject to certain requirements under
Russian anti-monopoly laws.
13. The Group operates in an industry that gives rise to
health, safety and environmental risks.
14. Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources data are
estimates only and are inherently uncertain, and
such Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources may be
depleted more rapidly than anticipated.
15. The Group’s licenses and concession rights to
explore and mine Ore Reserves may be suspended,
amended or terminated prior to the end of their
terms or may not be renewed.
16.The Group is exposed to risks relating to the multijurisdictional regulatory, social, legal, tax and political environment in which the Group operates.
17. The Group is exposed to the risk of re-inclusion in

Contingencies
The Board has reviewed and considered the contingent
liabilities of the Company and disclosed information
concerning such contingent liabilities in note 24 to
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Accordingly, for
detailed information about contingent liabilities, please
refer to note 24 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Details of the amounts of provisions are also disclosed
in note 20 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Tax contingencies
The new controlled foreign company (“CFC”) rules have
been introduced in Russia starting from 1 January 2015.
The rules apply to undistributed proﬁts of non-Russian
CFC controlled by Russian tax-resident Shareholders.
The Company is a tax-resident in Cyprus and managed
and controlled from Cyprus and the new CFC rules
shall not directly apply to the Group in relation to any
of its non-Russian afﬁliates. The CFC rules may apply
to Russian tax-resident controlling Shareholders of
the Company, where such Shareholder controls more
than 25% (or 10% where all Russian tax-resident
Shareholders together control more than 50%). The

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

rules also introduce certain reporting requirements for
such Russian tax-resident controlling Shareholders of
the Company in relation to non-Russian afﬁliates of the
Group where such Shareholders directly or indirectly
control more than 10% of those afﬁliates.
Legal contingencies
The Group’s business activities expose it to a variety of
lawsuits and claims which are monitored, assessed and
contested on an ongoing basis. Where management believes that a lawsuit or claim would result in the outﬂow
of the economic beneﬁts for the Group, a best estimate
of such outﬂow is included in provisions in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (refer to note 20 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements). As at 31 December 2018,
the amount of claims, where management were able to
assess the outﬂows, were approximately USD31 million,
as compared to USD36 million as at 31 December 2017.
In January 2013, the Company received a writ of summons and statement of claim ﬁled in the High Court of
Justice of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria (Abuja) by plaintiff BFIG Group Divino Corporation (“BFIG”)
against certain subsidiaries of the Company. It is a claim
for damages arising out of the defendants’ alleged tortious interference in the bid process for the sale of the
Nigerian government’s majority stake in the Aluminium
Smelter Company of Nigeria Plc (“ALSCON”) and alleged loss of the BFIG’s earnings resulting from its
failed bid for the said stake in ALSCON. BFIG sought
compensatory damages in the amount of USD2.8 billion plus interest.
In January 2014, the court granted the Company’s motion to join the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Attorney General of Nigeria to the case as co-defendants.
The last hearing took place on 8 November 2017. The
claim was struck out. BFIG may appeal.
Based on a preliminary assessment of the claim, the
Company does not expect the case to have any material
adverse effect on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or its
operations as a whole.
In January 2018, one of the Company’s subsidiaries,
ALSCON and the Bureau of Public Enterprises of Nigeria entered into an addendum to the original sale and
purchase contract regarding ALSCON on the key terms
and conditions as disclosed in the announcement of
the Company dated 19 January 2018.

Directors’ Report

Paragraph A.4.1 of the CG Code provides that non-executive Directors should be appointed for a speciﬁc term,
subject to re-election, and paragraph A.4.2 provides that
every Director, including those appointed for a speciﬁc
term, should be subject to retirement by rotation at least
every three years. The Company has addressed these requirements by including Article 24.2 of the Articles of
Association which provides that if any Director has at
the start of the annual general meeting been in ofﬁce for
three years or more since his last appointment or re-appointment, he shall retire at the annual general meeting.
As such, it is possible that a Director may be in ofﬁce for
more than three years depending upon the timing of the

Directors’ Report

(ceased to be a Director with effect from 28 June 2018)
and Ms. Olga Mashkovskaya (ceased to be a Director with
effect from 28 June 2018) were interested in/were directors of En+, Mr. Philippe Bernard Henri Mailfait (ceased
to be a Director with effect from 26 January 2019) is a
director of En+. Mr. Christopher Burnham (appointed as
an independent non-executive Director on 14 February
2019) and Mr. Nick Jordan (appointed as an independent
non-executive Director on 14 February 2019) are directors of En+. Mr. Ivan Glasenberg (ceased to be a Director
with effect from 10 April 2018) is interested in Glencore
and is a director and the chief executive ofﬁcer of Glencore. En+, SUAL Partners and Glencore are businesses
which compete or are likely to compete, either directly
or indirectly, with the Company. The summary below provides a description of these businesses, as well as facts
demonstrating that RUSAL is capable of carrying on its
own business independently of and at arm’s length from
these businesses.
In considering whether the Board and senior management of the Company are independent from the senior
management of each of En+, SUAL Partners and Glencore, the Directors have taken into account the following
general reasons, as well as the speciﬁc reasons applicable
to each of En+, SUAL Partners and Glencore:
(a) the Board consists of fourteen Directors, comprising
three executive Directors, three non-executive Directors and eight independent non-executive Directors;
(b) the decision-making mechanism of the Board set out
in the Articles of Association provides that all Directors with a conﬂicting interest shall not vote when
a conﬂicted resolution is to be discussed and voted
on;
(c) the Board has eight independent non-executive Directors with extensive corporate governance and ﬁnancial experience and is able to review, enhance and
implement measures to manage any conﬂict of interests between the businesses in which the Directors
have interests and the Group in order to protect minority shareholders’ interests and to manage the affairs of the Group independently of the businesses in
which the Directors have interests that may compete
with the Company. The independent non-executive
Directors make recommendations on proposed connected transactions by the Company. A committee of
the independent non-executive Directors will make
recommendations to the independent shareholders
on how to vote for any resolution that relates to future connected transactions pursuant to the Listing
Rules’ requirements; and

166

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

(d) all connected transactions which are subject to reporting and announcement requirements under the
Listing Rules have to be reviewed by the Audit Committee before they are approved by the Board.
In respect of each speciﬁc relevant business:
A. En+
En+ is a public company limited by shares with its registered ofﬁce at 44 Esplanade St. Helier, JE4 9WG, the Channel Islands. Pursuant to the disclosure of interests notices
ﬁled on 1 February 2019, Mr. Oleg Deripaska indirectly
holds 44.95% of the shares in En+. Please refer to Note 1
of the “Substantial Shareholders’ Interests” section.
En+ is a parent company for vertically integrated aluminium and power group, engaged in aluminium production
and energy generation. En+ specializes in metals that require high energy consumption and then looks for synergies between its energy producing and energy consuming
businesses.
Key assets of En+ include:
EuroSibEnergo – a wholly-owned power company with
core generating assets located in Siberia, Russia. EuroSibEnergo has in total installed capacity of 19.7 GW, out of
which 15.1 GW accounts for hydro power plants, three of
which are among top-20 hydro power plants in the world
in terms of installed capacity. It manages assets in power
generation, power trading and supply and engineering
services.
RUSAL – one of the largest producers of aluminium and
alumina in the world with fully integrated value chain
from bauxite mining to primary aluminium production.
Core aluminium producing facilities are located in Siberia
enjoying access to clean environmentally friendly hydro
power. RUSAL is one of the lowest cost producers globally, beneﬁting from cheap, clean and renewable hydro
energy in Siberia.
Independence from En+
Having considered all relevant factors, including the following, the Directors are satisﬁed that the Group can conduct its business independently of En+:
Independence of the Board and the Group’s Senior Management from the Senior Management of En+
The majority of the Board currently comprises of independent non-executive Directors. As at the Latest Practicable Date, four of the Directors were nominated by

Directors’ Report

En+, two of which Directors are also directors of En+. The
overlapping Directors at the Latest Practicable Date were
Mr. Christopher Burnham (being an independent nonexecutive Director with effect from 14 February 2019) and
Mr. Nick Jordan (being an independent non-executive Director with effect from 14 February 2019). Mr. Vyacheslav
Solomin was appointed as a chief executive ofﬁcer of En+
effective from 1 May 2018. All of the overlapping Directors have been elected on the basis of their qualiﬁcations
and breadth of experience, as set out in further details in
the “Proﬁles of Directors and Senior Management” section in this Annual Report. The Company’s non-executive
Directors attend Board meetings and provide guidance to
and decide on the Company’s important matters. Certain
of the non-executive Directors also sit on the committees of the Board and are responsible for the matters related to such committees.
For the general reasons stated above, the Directors are of
the view that the Group is able to operate independently
from En+, notwithstanding the fact that four Directors are
nominated by En+.
Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its businesses,
and operates as a business group which is separate from
and fully independent of En+.
The Group has, as disclosed under the section entitled
“Connected Transactions” of this Annual Report, entered
into contracts with the associates of En+ for the purchase
of electricity, and may continue to do so in the future.
As aluminium production is energy intensive, access to
relatively inexpensive Siberian hydropower is central to
the competitive strategy of the Group. However, notwithstanding the volume of such purchases from the associates of En+ and the importance of electricity costs to the
production activities of the Group, the Company does not
consider that it is, as a consequence, overly reliant on En+
for the following reasons:
(a) the Group has access to alternative sources of electricity as the Group’s Russian smelters are connected
to the Russian power grid, meaning that electricity
supplies can be obtained from various power plants,
all of which are also connected to the grid. These
supplies are available to the Group at market prices;
(b) the Group purchases electricity in accordance with
the Rules of the Wholesale Electricity and Capacity
Market at contract prices in accordance with direct
sale-purchase agreements with suppliers (both related or unrelated to the Controlling Shareholder) and/
or at market prices for electricity sold on the market

irrelative to the particular supplier. In 2018, the overall share of electricity purchased by the Group’s aluminium plants from the suppliers related to the Controlling Shareholder did not exceed 63%. The Group
has an option of switching to suppliers unrelated to
the Controlling Shareholder including by purchasing electricity on the wholesale electricity market,
though there would be certain price impact;
(c) none of the contracts is in take-or-pay format;
(d) the Group is currently already a very large volume
user with signiﬁcant negotiating power in the Russian
power market. In 2018, the Group has consumed approximately 28% of the power generated in Siberia;
and
(e) the power plants owned or controlled by En+ are located in remote regions where there is a limited number of large volume users located in proximity to such
plants. Sales to distant users would involve signiﬁcant
transmission losses and, because Siberia is a surplus
energy producer, the result is that these plants are
more reliant on the customer rather than vice versa.
Financial Independence
The Group’s ﬁnancial auditing system is independent
from En+ and employs a sufﬁcient number of dedicated
ﬁnancial accounting personnel responsible for ﬁnancial
auditing of the Group’s accounts. The Company has independent bank accounts and independent tax registration. The Group’s treasury operations are handled by the
Company’s treasury department, whose functions include
ﬁnancing, treasury and cash managements and which operates independently from En+ and shares no functions
or resources with En+. The Group’s choice of ﬁnancial
institutions is mainly based on the credit standing of
the institutions and the terms offered by them. As at the
year end of 2018, En+ had not provided any security and/
or guarantee over the Group’s borrowings. As a result of
the above analysis, the Directors believe that the Group is
able to maintain ﬁnancial independence from En+.
Extent of Competition
The only En+ businesses which compete with or are likely
to compete with the Group’s business, either directly or
indirectly, are those excluded businesses described below. However, by reason of the nature of such excluded
businesses and the clear delineation between the Group’s
business and such excluded business, the Group is fully
capable of carrying on its business independently of and
at arm’s length from such excluded business.

167

Directors’ Report

There is no real competitive threat to the Group’s business from the excluded business and there is no intention
of the Company to acquire such excluded business.
As at the Latest Practicable Date, “KraMZ” Ltd. is held
by En+ as to more than 30% of the issued share capital.
“KraMZ” Ltd. is therefore an associate of En+. Most of the
KraMZ plant’s raw materials (principally aluminium) are
purchased from companies within the Group (primarily
KrAZ). KraMZ’s main customers are industrial customers
located within Russia and abroad that purchase aluminium rods, proﬁles, tubes and cast aluminium alloys.
B. SUAL Partners
SUAL Partners is a limited liability company incorporated
under the laws of the Bahamas whose registered ofﬁce is
at 2nd Terrace West, Centreville, Nassau, Commonwealth
of the Bahamas. Please refer to Note 2 of the “Substantial Shareholders’ Interests” section for the shareholding
structure of SUAL Partners. SUAL Partners is a holding
company that holds interests in the Company and a separate kitchenware and houseware business.
Independence from SUAL Partners
Having considered all relevant factors, including the following, the Group is satisﬁed that it can conduct its business independently of SUAL Partners:
Independence of the Board and the Group’s Senior Management from the Senior Management of SUAL Partners
For the general reasons stated above, the Directors are of
the view that the Group is able to operate independently
from SUAL Partners because the Group’s day-to-day operations are managed by three executive Directors who
are independent of and not connected with SUAL Partners and the senior management team, who are all independent of and not connected with SUAL Partners.
Based on the above, the Board is satisﬁed that the Board
as a whole, together with the senior management team,
are able to perform their managerial role in the Group independently.
Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its businesses,
and operates as a business group which is separate from
and fully independent of SUAL Partners.
Financial Independence
The Group’s ﬁnancial auditing system is independent
from SUAL Partners and employs a sufﬁcient number of
168

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

dedicated ﬁnancial accounting personnel responsible for
ﬁnancial auditing of the Group’s accounts. The Company
has independent bank accounts and independent tax registration.
The Group’s treasury operations are handled by the Company’s treasury department, whose functions include ﬁnancing, treasury and cash management and which operates independently from SUAL Partners and shares no
functions or resources with SUAL Partners.
The Group’s choice of ﬁnancial institutions is mainly
based on the credit standing of the institutions and the
terms offered by them.
As at the year end of 2018, SUAL Partners had not provided any security and/or guarantee over the Group’s
borrowings.
As a result of the above analysis, the Directors believe
that the Group is ﬁnancially independent from SUAL
Partners.
Extent of Competition
The Board is of the opinion that SUAL Partners is not a
competitor of the Company.
C. Glencore
Amokenga Holdings is a company incorporated in Bermuda whose registered office is at 22 Victoria Street,
Canon’s Court, Hamilton, HM12, Bermuda. Amokenga
Holdings is ultimately controlled by Glencore, which is
a public company listed on the London Stock Exchange,
with a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange. No individual shareholder controls more
than 20% of the share capital of Glencore. Glencore’s
industrial and marketing activities are supported by a
global network of more than 90 offices located in over
50 countries and employ around 150,000 people, including contractors. Mr. Glasenberg is a shareholder, director
and chief executive ofﬁcer of Glencore, whose principal
business is the production and trading of commodities
including aluminium. Mr. Glasenberg was a non-executive Director of the Company (ceased to be a Director
with effect from 10 April 2018) and was also a member of
the corporate governance and nominations committee,
the standing committee and the Norilsk Nickel investment supervisory committee. As he was not an executive Director, he did not participate in the day-to-day
management of the Company, and accordingly was not
involved in the daily operations of the aluminium trading
division and so did not have access to conﬁdential contracts entered into by that division. Notwithstanding that
his role on the Board as a non-executive Director did not

Directors’ Report

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

require his involvement in the day-to-day management
of the Company, this did not preclude Mr. Glasenberg
from fulﬁlling his ﬁduciary duties. In case Mr. Glasenberg
had a conﬂicting interest, pursuant to the Articles of Association of the Company, he would abstain from voting
at Board meetings when a conflicted resolution was to
be discussed and voted on, subject to certain exceptions.

has independent bank accounts and independent tax
registration.

When the Group acquired certain of the alumina businesses of Glencore in late March 2007, it became subject to a contract for the supply of alumina to Glencore
that continued through 2008, in declining amounts. The
Group sold to Glencore approximately 22.38% of its excess alumina in monetary terms in 2018. The Company
also has long term supply contracts with Glencore for
alumina and primary aluminium, and Glencore was the
Group’s largest customer of alumina and primary aluminium in the ﬁnancial year, accounting for approximately
37.67% of the Group’s sales of primary aluminium.

The Group’s choice of ﬁnancial institutions is mainly
based on the credit standing of the institutions and the
terms offered by them.

Independence from Glencore
Having considered all relevant factors, including the following, the Group is satisﬁed that it can conduct its business independently of Glencore:
Independence of the Board and the Group’s Senior Management from the Senior Management of Glencore
For the general reasons stated above, the Directors are of
the view that the Group is able to operate independently
from Glencore notwithstanding that one former Director
is also a director of Glencore because the Group’s dayto-day operations are managed by three executive Directors and the senior management team who are independent of and not connected with Glencore.
Based on the above, the Board is satisﬁed that the Board
as a whole, together with the senior management team,
are able to perform their managerial role in the Group independently.
Operational Independence
The Group has full control of its assets and its businesses,
and operates as a business group which is separate from
and fully independent of Glencore.
Financial Independence
The Group’s ﬁnancial auditing system is independent
from Glencore and employs a sufﬁcient number of dedicated ﬁnancial accounting personnel responsible for ﬁnancial auditing of the Group’s accounts. The Company

The Group’s treasury operations are handled by the Company’s treasury department, whose functions include
ﬁnancing, treasury and cash management and which
operates independently from Glencore and shares no
functions or resources with Glencore.

As at the year end of 2018, Glencore had not provided any
security and/or guarantee over the Group’s borrowings.
As a result of the above analysis, the Directors believe
that the Group is ﬁnancially independent from Glencore.
Extent of Competition
Glencore participates in the marketing of both aluminium
and alumina from world markets as well as from industrial
assets in which it has an interest. Glencore has an economic interest of 47.2%19 in Century Aluminium Company, a NASDAQ-quoted company. Century owns and operates three aluminium smelters in the United States, in
Hawesville, Kentucky (the Hawesville aluminium smelter), Robards, Kentucky (the Sebree aluminium smelter)
and Goose Creek, South Carolina (the Mt. Holly aluminium smelter), and one aluminium smelter in Grundartangi,
Iceland (the Grundartangi aluminium smelter). Glencore,
in its business of trading, is also a customer of the Group.
As disclosed in the Company’s announcement dated 28
January 2019, on 28 January 2019, En+ announced that it
had entered into a securities exchange agreement and
certain other related agreements with certain subsidiaries of Glencore, pursuant to which Glencore shall transfer
8.75% of the Company’s shares to En+ in consideration
for En+ issuing new GDRs to Glencore representing approximately 10.55% of the enlarged share capital of En+.
After the aforementioned share swap is completed, the
indirect shareholding of Glencore in the Shares will reduce to 0%.

17 Substantial Shareholders’ Interests

the following interests or short positions in the Shares or
underlying Shares of the Company were notiﬁed to the

GOVERNANCE
REPORT
1. Corporate governance practices
The Company adopts international standards of corporate governance. The Directors believe that high quality corporate governance leads to successful business
development and increases the investment potential of
the Company, providing more security for shareholders,
partners and customers as well as reinforcing the Company’s internal control systems.
By working with international institutions such as the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
and the International Finance Corporation, the Company developed and implemented its corporate governance standards, based on the principles of transparent
and responsible business operations.
The Company adopted a corporate code of ethics that
sets out the Company’s values and principles for many
of its areas of operations.
The Directors adopted a corporate governance code
which is based on the CG Code in a Board meeting on
11 November 2010. The Directors believe that the Company has complied with the code provisions of the CG
Code during the Review Period, other than as described
in paragraphs 3(b) and 3(g) of this Corporate Governance Report.

178

The Directors are committed to upholding the corporate governance of the Company to ensure that formal
and transparent procedures are in place to protect and
maximize the interests of the Shareholders.
Set out below is a detailed discussion of the corporate
governance practices adopted and observed by the
Company during the Review Period.

2. Directors’ securities transactions

Directors conﬁrmed that they had fully complied with
the required standard set out in the Model Code and
the Code for Securities Transactions throughout the
Review Period.

(d) Board functions and duties

(f) Shareholders’ Agreements

The Board is collectively responsible for the management and operations of the Company. The principal
functions and duties conferred on the Board include:

The Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company and
the Shareholders’ Agreement among Major Shareholders were both entered into on 22 January 2010 and are
still in force. For brief details of these Shareholders’
Agreements, please see Appendix A and Appendix B.

— responsibility for the approval and monitoring of
the overall development strategies, annual budgets,

assist the Board in formulating and implementing the
strategy of the Group and monitoring its performance.

183

Corporate Governance Report

(g) Board meetings at which Directors have material
interests
A.1.7 of the CG Code states that “If a substantial shareholder or a director has a conﬂict of interest in a matter
to be considered by the board which the board has determined to be material, the matter should be dealt with
by a physical board meeting rather than a written resolution. Independent non-executive directors who, and
whose close associates, have no material interest in the
transaction should be present at that board meeting.”
The Board generally endeavoured throughout the
twelve-month period ended 31 December 2018 to ensure that it did not deal with business by the way of
written resolution where a substantial Shareholder of
the Company or a Director had disclosed an interest in
a matter to be considered by the Board which the Board
determined to be material. As a result, there were no
occurrence (out of the 22 written resolutions the Board
passed during the period) when urgent business was
dealt with by the Board by way of written resolution
where a material interest of a Director was stated to
have been disclosed.
Of the 12 Board meetings held in the twelve month
period ended 31 December 2018 where one or more
Directors had disclosed a material interest, all the independent non-executive Directors were present at all six
of the Board meetings held.
Of the 12 Board meetings held, there were four occasions where an independent non-executive Director
had a material interest in the transaction. On such occurrences, the independent non-executive Director abstained from voting and the resolutions approving entry
into such transactions were passed by the requisite majority excluding the materially interested independent
non-executive Director.

4. Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
The roles of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer are segregated and are independent
to each other. The Chairman (being Mr. Matthias Warnig
until he resigned with effect from 31 December 2018;
being Mr. Jean-Pierre Thomas with effect from 1 January 2019 until he resigned with effect from 26 January
2019; being Mr. Bernard Zonneveld with effect from
6 March 2019) is chieﬂy responsible for maintaining
the effective operation of the Board. The Chairman is
also responsible for chairing Board meetings, brieﬁng
Board members on issues discussed at Board meetings
and ensuring good corporate governance practices and
184

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

procedures are established taking into account the relevant requirements set out in A2.2 to A2.9 of the CG
Code. The role as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is primarily
concerned with the supervision of the execution of the
policies determined by the Board particularly in the areas of production and supply chain, ﬁnancial management and corporate ﬁnance, sales and marketing and
others. The Company has approved a policy statement
setting out those responsibilities to be undertaken by
the Chairman and those to be undertaken by the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer. The Chairman is responsible for
leadership of the Board and for creating the conditions
necessary to allow the Board and individual Directors
to operate effectively. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Group
and ensuring that the strategic decisions made by the
Board are implemented.

5. Independent non-executive Directors
Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules requires that an issuer
must appoint independent non-executive directors representing at least one-third of the board. The current
composition of the Board represents an appropriate mix
of Directors which offers sufﬁcient independent checks
and balances and an appropriate governance structure
for the Company. As at the Latest Practicable Date, 8 out
of 14 Directors are independent non-executive Directors.
The Board believes that all independent non-executive
Directors have appropriate and sufﬁcient industry or ﬁnance experience and qualiﬁcations to carry out their
duties so as to protect the interests of shareholders of
the Company. Each of the independent non-executive
Directors has undertaken to inform the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange and the Securities and Futures Commission as soon as practicable if there is any subsequent change of circumstances which may affect their
independence. The Company has also received a written conﬁrmation from each of the independent non-executive Directors in respect of their independence. The
Board considers that all independent non-executive
Directors are independent by reference to the factors
stated in the Listing Rules.

6. Nomination of Directors and the work
of the Corporate Governance and
Nomination Committee
The Company established a corporate governance and
nomination committee with written terms of reference
in compliance with the CG Code.

Corporate Governance Report

The primary functions of the Corporate Governance
and Nomination Committee are, among other things,
to develop, recommend and annually review corporate
governance guidelines, policies and practices for the
Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, to oversee
corporate governance matters, to review and monitor
the training and continuous professional development
of Directors and senior management, to develop, review
and monitor the Company’s code of conduct and compliance manual and applicable to employees and Directors, reviewing the Company’s compliance with the CG
Code set out in Appendix 14 of the Listing Rules and
disclosure in the Corporate Governance Report, and to
make recommendations to the Board, including those
in relation to the appointment and removal of Directors.
The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee is provided with sufﬁcient resources to discharge its
duties, and its terms of reference also permit it to obtain
access to a legal adviser.
In recommending a candidate for appointment to the
Board, the Corporate Governance and Nomination
Committee is required to determine criteria, objectives
and procedures for selecting Board members, including factors such as independence (in the case of independent non-executive directors), diversity, age, future
succession planning, integrity, skills, expertise, experience, knowledge about the Company’s business and
industry, and willingness to devote adequate time and
effort to Board responsibilities. In identifying suitable
candidates, the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee is required to use open advertising or
the services of external advisers to facilitate the search,
consider candidates from a wide range of backgrounds
and consider candidates on merit against objective criteria, taking care that appointees have enough time to
devote to the position.
The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee consists of a majority of independent non-executive Directors. The members are as follows:

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee has held 8 meetings during the Review Period. At
these meetings, the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee considered, amongst other things,
the annual general meeting materials.
The members of the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee have regularly attended and actively
participated in meetings. For the attendance record of
the meetings held by the Corporate Governance and
Nomination Committee during 2018, please refer to
paragraph 3(a) of this Corporate Governance Report.
According to the Articles of Association, at every annual general meeting, one-third of the Directors or, if
their number is not three or a multiple of three, the
number nearest to one-third shall retire from ofﬁce;
but if any Director has at the start of the annual general meeting been in ofﬁce for three years or more since
his or her last appointment or reappointment, he or she
shall retire at the annual general meeting. The Directors to retire by rotation shall be, ﬁrst, those who wish
to retire and not be re-appointed to ofﬁce and, second,
those who have been longest in ofﬁce since their last
appointment or re-appointment. As between persons
who became or were last re-appointed directors on the
same day, those to retire shall (unless they otherwise
agree among themselves) be determined by lot. The
details of the Directors who will retire and offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming annual general
meeting are set out in the relevant circular issued by the
Company.
The Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee also monitors the implementation of the board diversity policy of the Company. The Company recognises and embraces the beneﬁts of having a diverse Board
to enhance the quality of its performance. The current
mix of skills, experience and other diversity criteria of
directors, including but not limited to sex, age, nationality and educational background, provides for a balanced
composition of the Board.

10. Directors’ Responsibility for the
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Directors acknowledge that it is their responsibility to prepare the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for
the year ended 31 December 2018, in accordance with
applicable laws and IFRS, and that these consolidated
ﬁnancial statements must give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the Group and of the results and cash
ﬂow for that period.
The Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires the Directors
to prepare consolidated ﬁnancial statements for each
ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Company and its subsidiaries and of the
proﬁt or loss of the Company and its subsidiaries for
that period. In preparing these consolidated ﬁnancial
statements, the Directors are required to:

190

— select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently;
— make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
— state whether applicable accounting standards have
been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements;
and
— assess the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to
going concern; and
— use the going concern basis of accounting unless
they either intend to liquidate the Company or to
cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but
to do so.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain
the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the
Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial
statements comply with Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets
of the Company and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and
integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in Jersey
governing the preparation and dissemination of consolidated ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation
in other jurisdictions.

Corporate Governance Report

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of the Group is required to
regularly present and explain to the Audit Committee
and the Board reports on the Group’s ﬁnancial position
and operating results, and report other matters that may
have a material impact upon the ﬁnancial performance
and operations in order that the Audit Committee and
the Board may make informed decisions.

ate for Control, which is responsible for developing and
monitoring the Company’s risk management policies.
The risk management group includes employees that
are appropriately qualiﬁed to manage ﬁnancial, operational and compliance risks. The Directorate for Control
reports regularly to the Board on its activities including
those related to the risk management system.

The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The reporting responsibility of the external auditors of the Company on the
ﬁnancial statements of the Group are set out in the independent auditors’ report on pages 199 and 203 of this
Annual Report.

The Company aims to promote a risk-aware culture
among all its employees including all the management
layers and those directly engaged in the production process. The Company’s risk management policies, that are
designed to identify, analyze and manage the risks, are
delivered to relevant employees so that they can understand the coherence between their responsibilities and
the risks faced by the Company as a whole. Thus, all the
Company risks are consolidated in the Risk Map of the
Company that is being monitored by all the management
layers and responsible employees are allocated to each
risk. The Directorate for Control considers risk management instruments to be applied to each risk. An annual
insurance program is developed based on the Risk Map
of the Company. In respect of potentially risky instruments, such as hedging of commodity prices, foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rates, special approval by the Hedge Committee of the Company is required. Such a transparent attitude to risk management
improves risk awareness of employees including understanding of appropriate risk limits, relevant controls and
instruments to monitor risks, adherence to risk limits as
well as the ability to respond to the changes of the business environment on a timely basis. It is noted that after
6 April 2018 the Company was unable to use derivatives
to reduce or eliminate exposure to risks including those
related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates,
commodity market prices, for such ﬁnancial instruments
are mainly nominated in USD and, thus, the OFAC Sanctions signiﬁcantly impeded application thereof despite
the issuance of the General License 14. The Company is
only to resume an access to the ﬁnancial hedging market
in 2019 after delisting from the SDN List.

11. Risk Management and Internal Control
The Company’s risk management and internal control
systems have been designed to achieve strategic objectives of the Company, safeguard the assets of the
Company, determine the nature and extent of the risks,
maintain proper accounting records, ensure execution
with appropriate authority and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. The risk management system has always represented the core part of the Company’s internal control system, however it has become
of even greater importance due to the increased level
of uncertainty and volatility on global markets, including those related to the signiﬁcant political risks faced
by the Company. The Board fully acknowledges its responsibility to establish and maintain appropriate and
effective risk management and internal control systems
that are designed to achieve the Company’s strategic
objectives based on compliance with the risk appetite
of Shareholders alongside with interests of other stakeholders.
In accordance with CG Code provision C.2.1. , the Board
reviews the Company’s risk management and internal
control systems on a quarterly basis to ensure their effectiveness. The Company has an internal audit function
in the bounds of the Directorate for Control, responsible
for internal audit and business coordination (hereinafter
referred to as the Directorate for Control), and Audit
Committee that carries out the analysis and independent appraisal of the adequacy and effectiveness of the
Group’s risk management and internal control systems.
The Board and the Directorate for Control provide assurance in terms of adequacy of resources, staff qualiﬁcations and experience, training programs and budgets
of the core functions of the Group such as accounting,
internal audit and ﬁnancial reporting. The Board has established a risk management group within the Director-

The Company’s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Company’s risk
management policies and procedures and reviews the
adequacy of the risk management framework in relation
to the risks faced by the Company. The Company’s Audit
Committee is assisted in its oversight role by the Company’s internal audit function, which undertakes both
regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls
and procedures, the results of which are reported to the
Audit Committee.
The Board, the Company’s Audit Committee and the
Directorate for Control aim to ensure that the internal
control capability is regularly improved and enhanced.
191

Corporate Governance Report

However it is important to note that the Company’s internal control and risk management system are designed
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The results of the Board’s quarterly reviews of the Company’s risk management and internal control system
during the year 2018 are as follows:
Operational Controls
Operational controls have been established for the
management of a wide range of risks, including those related to the production process, procurement, cash ﬂow
management, foreign currency exchange rates, fraud,
competitors and politics (i.e. other than those related to
compliance and ﬁnancial reporting), covering the core
scope of responsibility of the Directorate for Control.
The Audit Committee issued an annual plan of audits
and revisions to be performed over 12 months. However, unplanned audits and revisions were performed on a
regular basis to guarantee that operational controls are
effective and efﬁcient. The operational controls system
is based on both best practice patterns and recommendations of audits and revisions (compliance with such
recommendations is also regularly checked). The Directorate for Control reported to the Board on results of
audits and revisions on a quarterly basis. During 2018,
the Directorate for Controls assessed all the material
risks identiﬁed and developed relevant risk management patterns to be applied in accordance with the
Company’s risk management policies and the risk appetites of Shareholders.
Financial Controls
The Company’s risk management and internal control
systems are effective in terms of ﬁnancial controls as
the Board fully acknowledges its responsibility to provide stakeholders with true and fair ﬁnancial statements
which reﬂect all the material aspects of the Company’s
affairs and thus may be relied on for reasonable decisions. The ﬁnancial reporting function was regularly audited by the Directorate for Control and external auditors to prevent material misstatement due to fraud or
error. The Board aims to increase the level of automation of the ﬁnancial reporting function on an on-going
basis to increase the efﬁciency and effectiveness of
ﬁnancial controls of the Company. The Board ensures
that ﬁnancial controls of the Company are strong and
based on best practice patterns. Financial controls were
checked in the bounds of all the audits and revisions
performed by the Directorate for Control.

192

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Compliance Controls
The Company operates in ﬁve continents and has business affairs in many countries all over the world which
creates a need to comply with various legal requirements including those related to environment. The
Board and the Directorate for Control acknowledge the
importance to comply with legal and environmental requirements in order to be a green aluminium manufacturer and a good corporate citizen. Compliance controls
are checked in the bounds of all the audits and revisions
performed by the Directorate for Control.
The internal control and risk management capability is
regularly improved and enhanced. The key steps and directions thereof for the year 2018 are as follows:
Key steps and directions of the procurement optimization in 2018:
— Control of procurement of materials and equipment and selection of transportation and construction services, including participation in procurement corporate committees. The relevant savings
amounted to USD6.9 million.
— Implementation of the project for the disposal of
the Company’s non-liquid and non-core assets. The
relevant income amounted to USD77 million.
— Optimization of patterns used by the Company to
work with business-to-business trading platforms.
— Maintenance of procurement transparency through
rebranding and monitoring of the suppliers’ hotline.
— Leadership in working with flux and ligature testing
to find alternative suppliers in order to move from
sole purchasing to having more competition and
facilitate purchasing managers to obtain low prices
with standard quality.
— Development and implementation of tools to improve the efficiency of procurement.
Key steps and directions of the risk management optimization in 2018:
— Organization of independent risk audits of Company’s production facilities conducted by specialists
Willis Group for risk mitigation purposes and the
optimization of Company’s insurance programs.
— Development and analysis of the annual Risk Map
which was updated on a quarterly basis.
— Quarterly reporting on the Company’s risk management affairs to the Audit Committee.
— Update of the insurance program for 2018-2019.
— IrkAZ pilot project to unify and optimize the risk
management process for standalone production
and mine facilities was initiated in 2018.

Corporate Governance Report

Information Disclosure Controls
Since the Company’s listing, it has been subject to requirements relating to continuous disclosure obligations, including determination and disclosure of inside information. In the beginning of 2010, the Board
delegated its authority to assess whether information
constitutes inside information, whether it is subject to
immediate disclosure or whether any safe harbor provisions may apply; to determine the timing and format of
disclosure; to appoint ofﬁcers responsible for collection, preliminary analysis and processing of the information within various business subdivisions of the Group;
to appoint the Company’s authorized representatives
to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange; and to decide on
trading halts and other issues to be raised with the Disclosure Committee. At the same time, an internal policy
regulating the treatment of inside information was adopted within the Group.
The internal control system applied in the Group with
respect to inside information ensures that any piece of
information that may constitute inside information is
promptly escalated to the Disclosure Committee and,
should it constitute inside information, is disclosed. Disclosure of inside information is made through the tools
available to the Company under applicable legislation
in every jurisdiction where the Company is subject to
such disclosure (e.g. via the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
web-page in Hong Kong and Interfax agency in Russia).
It is important to note that the Directorate for Control
did not identify in the year 2018 any signiﬁcant violations of operational, ﬁnancial or compliance controls
nor any signiﬁcant risks such as those that may potentially give rise to uncertainties about ability of the Company to continue to operate as a going concern.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

12. Relevant Ofﬁcers’ Securities Transactions
The Company has also adopted a code for Securities
Transactions by Relevant Ofﬁcers of the Company (the
“Relevant Ofﬁcers Code”). The Relevant Ofﬁcers Code
was based on Appendix 10 to the Listing Rules but it
was made more exacting. It applies to any employee of
the Company or a director or employee of a subsidiary
of the Company who, because of such ofﬁce or employment, is likely to be in possession of unpublished price
sensitive information in relation to the Company or its
securities. The Relevant Ofﬁcers Code was adopted by
the Board on 9 April 2010.

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities

Company law requires the Directors to prepare consolidated ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the

responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably
open to them to safeguard the assets of the company
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

Under company law the Directors must not approve the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the
Company for that period. In preparing these ﬁnancial

INDEPENDENT
AUDITOR’S
REPORT
To the Members of United Company RUSAL Plc

Emphasis of Matter

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial
Statementes

We draw attention to Note 1(d) of the consolidated
ﬁnancial statement, which describes the inclusion of
the Company, its ultimate beneﬁcial owner and certain
companies under common control in the Specially Designated Nationals List issued by the Ofﬁce of Foreign
Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury of
the United States of America in April 2018 with further
removal of the Company from the above-mentioned
List in January 2019.

Opinion
We have audited the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
of United Company RUSAL Plc (the “Company”) and its
subsidiaries (the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position as at 31 December
2018, the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash ﬂows for
the year then ended, and notes, comprising signiﬁcant
accounting policies and other explanatory information.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated ﬁnancial position of the Group as at
31 December 2018, and its consolidated ﬁnancial performance and its consolidated cash ﬂows for the year
then ended in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), and have been prepared
in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
(Jersey) Law 1991 and the disclosure requirements of
the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signiﬁcance in our audit
of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the current
period. These matters were addressed in the context of
our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as a
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We
are independent of the Group in accordance with the
International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’
Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“IESBA
Code”), and we have fulﬁlled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code. We believe
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment
Please refer to the Note 13 in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

How the matter was addressed in our audit

The key audit matter
The Group has signiﬁcant property, plant and equipment balance which is material to the ﬁnancial statements as at 31 December 2018.
Current global market conditions, including ﬂuctuations in LME aluminium prices, market premiums
and alumina purchase prices, may indicate that some
property, plant and equipment items may be subject
to either impairment loss or reversal of previously recognised impairment loss. This is in particular related to
such cash generating units (CGUs) as alumina plants
and bauxite mines.
As at the reporting date management performs valuation of the recoverable amount of the Group’s assets
and cash generating units as their value in use.
Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting and discounting future cash ﬂows, which are the
basis of the assessment of recoverability, this is one
of the key judgmental areas that our audit is concentrated on.

For aluminium, alumina and bauxite CGUs we evaluated the reasonableness of the expected cash ﬂow
forecasts by comparing them with the latest budgets
approved by the Board of Directors, externally derived
data as well as our own assessments in relation to key
inputs such as production levels, forecasted aluminium sales prices, forecasted alumina purchase prices,
costs inﬂation, foreign currency exchange rates, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We also considered the historic accuracy of management’s forecasts
by comparing prior year forecasts to actual results.
We used our own valuation specialists to assist us in
evaluating the assumptions and methodology used by
the Group.
In particular, we challenged:
– aluminium and alumina smelters and bauxite mines
costs projections by comparing them with historical
results and industry peers;
– the key assumptions for long-term revenue growth
rates in the forecasts by comparing them with historical results, economic and industry forecasts; and
– the discount rates used. Speciﬁcally, we recalculated
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital using
market comparable information.
We also performed sensitivity analysis on the discounted cash ﬂow forecasts and assessed whether the
Group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key
assumptions, including forecasted aluminium and alumina prices and discount rates, reﬂected the risks inherent in the valuation of property, plant and equipment.

report.

In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the
Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors
either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Our opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
does not cover the other information and we will not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Those charged with governance are responsible for
overseeing the Group’s ﬁnancial reporting process.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other
information identiﬁed above when it becomes available
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

Responsibilities of the Directors and
Those Charged with Governance for the
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and
fair presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS, the Companies (Jersey)
Law 1991 and the disclosure requirements of the Hong
Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable
the preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements
that are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error.

Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of
the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

201

Financial Statements

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform
audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufﬁcient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the
Directors.
— Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors’
use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether
a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to
the related disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as
a going concern.

202

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and
content of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements,
including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements represent the underlying
transactions and events in a manner that achieves
fair presentation.
— Obtain sufﬁcient appropriate audit evidence regarding the ﬁnancial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an
opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
We are responsible for the direction, supervision
and performance of the group audit. We remain
solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and signiﬁcant audit ﬁndings, including any signiﬁcant deﬁciencies in internal control that
we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that
may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged
with governance, we determine those matters that were
of most signiﬁcance in the audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in
our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter
should not be communicated in our report because the
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably
be expected to outweigh the public interest beneﬁts of
such communication.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory
Requirements
Matter on which we are required to report by exception.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following
matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
— adequate accounting records have not been kept by
the Company; or
— returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
— the ﬁnancial statements of the Company are not in
agreement with the accounting records; or
— we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

NOTES TO THE
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED
31 DECEMBER 2018

1 Background
(a) Organisation
United Company RUSAL Plc (the “Company” or
“RUSAL”) was established by the controlling shareholder of RUSAL Limited (“RUSAL”) as a limited liability
company under the laws of Jersey on 26 October 2006.
On 27 January 2010, the Company successfully completed a dual placing on the Main Board of The Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (“Stock Exchange”)
and the Professional Segment of NYSE Euronext Paris
(“Euronext Paris”) (the “Global Offering”) and changed
its legal form from a limited liability company to a public limited company.
On 23 March 2015, the shares of the Company were
admitted to listing on PJSC Moscow Exchange MICEXRTS (“Moscow Exchange”) in the First Level quotation
list. The trading of shares on Moscow Exchange commenced on 30 March 2015. There was no issue of new
shares.

The Company has ﬁled the application for the delisting of its global depositary receipts (“GDSs”) with the
Euronext Paris. The GDSs were delisted on 7 May 2018.
The Company’s registered ofﬁce is 44 Esplanade, St Helier, Jersey, JE4 9WG, Channel Islands.
The Company directly or through its wholly-owned
subsidiaries controls a number of production and trading entities (refer to note 26) engaged in the aluminium
business and other entities, which together with the
Company are referred to as “the Group”.

Financial Statements

(b) Operations
The Group operates in the aluminium industry primarily in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Guinea, Jamaica,
Ireland, Italy, Nigeria and Sweden and is principally engaged in the mining and reﬁning of bauxite and nepheline ore into alumina, the smelting of primary aluminium from alumina and the fabrication of aluminium
and aluminium alloys into semi-fabricated and ﬁnished
products. The Group sells its products primarily in Europe, Russia, other countries of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (“CIS”), Asia and North America.
(c) Business environment in emerging economies
The Russian Federation, Ukraine, Jamaica, Nigeria and
Guinea have been experiencing political and economic
changes that have affected, and may continue to affect,
the activities of enterprises operating in these environments. Consequently, operations in these countries
involve risks that typically do not exist in other markets, including reconsideration of privatisation terms in
certain countries where the Group operates following
changes in governing political powers.
The conﬂict in Ukraine and related events has increased
the perceived risks of doing business in the Russian
Federation. The imposition of economic sanctions on
Russian individuals and legal entities by the European
Union, the United States of America, Japan, Canada,
Australia and others, as well as retaliatory sanctions imposed by the Russian government, has resulted in increased economic uncertainty including more volatile
equity markets, a depreciation of the Russian Rouble, a
reduction in both local and foreign direct investment
inﬂows and a signiﬁcant tightening in the availability of
credit. In particular, some Russian entities may be experiencing difﬁculties in accessing international equity
and debt markets and may become increasingly dependent on Russian state banks to ﬁnance their operations.
The longer term effects of recently implemented sanctions, as well as the threat of additional future sanctions,
are difﬁcult to determine.

220

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The consolidated ﬁnancial statements reﬂect management’s assessment of the impact of the Russian, Ukrainian, Jamaican, Nigerian and Guinean business environments on the operations and the ﬁnancial position of
the Group. The future business environment may differ
from management’s assessment.
(d) OFAC Sanctions
On 6 April 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s
Ofﬁce of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) designated,
amongst others, the Company, as a Specially Designated
National (“SDN”) (the “OFAC Sanctions”).
As a result, all property or interests in property of the
Company and its subsidiaries located in the United
States or in the possession of U.S. Persons were blocked,
must have been frozen, and could not be transferred,
paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in. Several
general licenses were issued at the time of the designation and later on authorizing certain transactions with
the Company, its majority shareholder En+ Group Plc
(“En+”), and with their respective debt and equity.
On 27 January 2019 OFAC announced removal of the
Company and En+ from OFAC’s SDN List with immediate effect. The removal was subject to and conditional
upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions including, but not limited to, corporate governance changes,
including, inter alia, overhauling the composition of the
Board to ensure that independent directors constitute
the majority of the Board, stepping down of the Chairman of the Board, and ongoing reporting and certiﬁcations by the Company to OFAC concerning compliance
with the conditions for removal.

Financial Statements

2 Basis of preparation
(a) Statement of compliance
These consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), which collective term includes all International Accounting Standards and related interpretations, promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”), and the disclosure
requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance.
These consolidated ﬁnancial statements also comply
with the applicable disclosure provisions of the Rules
Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.
This is the ﬁrst set of the Group’s annual ﬁnancial statements in which IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments have been
applied. Changes to signiﬁcant accounting policies are
described in Note 3. A number of other new standards are
also effective from 1 January 2018 but they do not have a
material effect on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements.
Due to the transition methods chosen by the Group
in applying these standards, comparative information
throughout these ﬁnancial statements has not been restated to reﬂect the requirements of the new standards.
A number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1
January 2019 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Group has not early adopted the following new
or amended standards in preparing these consolidated
ﬁnancial statements.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The following amended standards and interpretations
are not expected to have a signiﬁcant impact on the
Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
— IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Tax Treatments.
— Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
(Amendments to IFRS 9).
— Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments to IAS 28).
— Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement
(Amendments to IAS 19).
— Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015–2017
Cycle – various standards.
— Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards.
— IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts.
Of those standards that are not yet effective, based
on the information collected to date and analysis performed by the Group, IFRS 16 Leases is expected to
have a material impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements in the period of initial application.
IFRS 16 replaces existing leases guidance including IAS
17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases—Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning
on or after 1 January 2019. The Group has not elected
the early adoption option.

221

Financial Statements

IFRS 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a rightof-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to
make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value
items. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current
standard – i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as ﬁnance or operating leases.
As a lessee, the Group can either apply the standard
using a:
— retrospective approach; or
— modiﬁed retrospective approach with optional
practical expedients.
The lessee applies the election consistently to all of its
leases.
The Group will apply IFRS 16 initially on 1 January 2019,
using the modiﬁed retrospective approach. Therefore,
the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at 1 January 2019, with no restatement
of comparative information.
When applying the modiﬁed retrospective approach to
leases previously classiﬁed as operating leases under
IAS 17, the lessee can elect, on a lease-by-lease basis,
whether to apply a number of practical expedients on
transition. The Group is assessing the potential impact
of using these practical expedients.

3 Signiﬁcant accounting policies
(a) Changes in accounting policies
The Group has initially adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from
Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments from 1 January 2018.
The effect of initially applying these standards is mainly
attributed to the following:
— timing of recognition of revenue for the transportation services after the control for the related goods
has been transferred to customer (revenue is to be
recognised over time from goods control transfer
till completion of the transportation);
— classiﬁcation of revenue earned from the contracts which bear price ﬁnalisation options as other
revenue instead of revenue from contracts with
customers;
— an increase in impairment losses recognised on
ﬁnancial assets;
— disclosures to be presented as required by the new
standards.
(i) IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations.
The Group has adopted IFRS 15 using the cumulative
effect method (without practical expedients), with the
effect of initially applying this standard recognised at
the date of initial application (i.e. 1 January 2018). Accordingly, the information presented for 2017 has not
been restated – i.e. it is presented, as previously reported, under IAS 18, IAS 11 and related interpretations.

Financial Statements

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The details of the new signiﬁcant accounting policies and the nature of the changes to previous accounting policies
in relation to the Group’s various goods and services are set out below.
Nature, timing of satisfaction of
performance obligations,
significant payment terms

Sales of goods

Comprise sale of primary aluminium,
alloys, alumina, bauxite and other
products. Customers obtain control
of the goods supplied when the
goods are delivered to the point
when risks are transferred based on
Incoterms delivery terms stated in
the contract. Invoices are generated
and revenue is recognised at that
point in time. Invoices are usually
payable within 60 days or in advance.
Under certain Group sale contracts
the final price for the goods shipped
is determined a few months later
than the delivery took place. Under
current requirements the Group
determines the amount of revenue
at the moment of recognition based
on estimated selling price at the
date of the invoice issued. At price
finalisation the difference between
estimated price and actual one is
recognised as other revenue.

Nature of change in accounting policy

Under IAS 18 revenue was recognised
when related risks and rewards of
ownership were transferred under
delivery terms of the contracts.
Revenue was recognised at this point
provided that the revenue and costs
can be measured reliably, the recovery
of the consideration is probable and
there is no continuing management
involvement with the goods.
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised
when a customer obtains control of
the goods. It has not significantly
impacted the Group’s revenue
recognition approach and the timing
of revenue recognition.
For the contract with revenue
finalisation feature IFRS 15 also has
not resulted in a significant change
in the amount of revenue recognised
and the moment of recognition. But
IFRS 15 effected the classification
of the revenue recognised: revenue
initially recognised at the moment of
control transfer to the customer is
recognised as revenue from contract
with customers. The amount of
price adjustment on finalisation is
recognised as other revenue.

Nature of change in accounting policy

As part of sales of goods the Group
also performs transportation to the
customer under contract terms.
In certain cases the control for
goods delivered is transferred to
customer at earlier point than the
transportation is completed. The
fee for the transportation services
is included in the amount invoiced
for the goods supplied (refer to the
above caption).

Under IAS 18 revenue was recognised
both for goods and transportation
services at the point in time when the
risks and rewards of goods ownership
transfer to customer.

The Group is involved in sales of
energy to 3rd and related parties.
Invoices are issued once a month at
the end of month and paid within 30
days.

Under previously effective accounting
policies revenue was recognised on
the last day of the month. Under IFRS
15 revenue is recognised over time.
Effectively it has not impacted either
total amount of revenue recognized,
or its classification.

Under IFRS 15 the transportation
revenue is recognised over time from
goods control transfer till completion
of the transportation.
This has resulted in certain deferral of
revenue recognition, but did not have
a significant impact.

The impact of transition to IFRS 15 on retained earnings is not signiﬁcant. Thus no transitional adjustments were
made by theGroup.

(ii) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments sets out requirements for
recognising and measuring ﬁnancial assets, ﬁnancial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-ﬁnancial
items. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The details of new signiﬁcant accounting policies and
the nature and effects of the changes to previous accounting policies are set out below.
Classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial assets and
ﬁnancial liabilities
IFRS 9 contains a new classiﬁcation and measurement
approach for ﬁnancial assets that reﬂects the business
model in which assets are managed and their cash ﬂow
characteristics.
IFRS 9 contains three principal classiﬁcation categories
for ﬁnancial assets: measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”) and
fair value through proﬁt or loss (“FVTPL”). The classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial assets under IFRS 9 is generally based
on the business model in which a ﬁnancial asset is managed and its contractual cash ﬂow characteristics. The
standard eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of
held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for
sale. Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts
where the host is a ﬁnancial asset in the scope of the
standard are never bifurcated. Instead, the hybrid ﬁnancial instrument as a whole is assessed for classiﬁcation.
IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements in IAS
39 for the classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial liabilities.
The Group’s ﬁnancial assets most fall within category
of ﬁnancial assets measured at amortised cost both under IAS 39 and IFRS 9 requirements. The only exception is derivative ﬁnancial assets measured at fair value
through proﬁt or loss. The same applies to the Group’s
ﬁnancial liabilities. Thus the adoption of IFRS 9 has not
had a signiﬁcant effect on the Group’s accounting policies related to classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities as well as derivative
ﬁnancial instruments. The impact of IFRS 9 on the impairment of ﬁnancial assets is set out below.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
IFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with
an ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) model. The new impair-

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

ment model applies inter alia to ﬁnancial assets measured at amortised cost. Under IFRS 9, credit losses
are recognised earlier than under IAS 39. The Group’s
ﬁnancial assets at amortised cost consist of trade and
other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Under IFRS 9, loss allowances are measured on either
of the following bases:
—12-month ECLs : these are ECLs that result from
possible default events within the 12 months after
the reporting date; and
—lifetime ECLs : these are ECLs that result from all
possible default events over the expected life of a
ﬁnancial instrument.
The Group measures loss allowances at an amount
equal to lifetime ECLs, except for bank balances for
which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring over
the expected life of the ﬁnancial instrument) has not
increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition. The
Group measures loss allowances for trade receivables
at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.
When determining whether the credit risk of a ﬁnancial
asset has increased signiﬁcantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers
reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This
includes both quantitative and qualitative information
and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience
and informed credit assessment and including forwardlooking information.
The Group assumes that the credit risk on a ﬁnancial asset has increased signiﬁcantly if it is more than 30 days
past due.
The Group considers a ﬁnancial asset to be in default
when:
— the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations
to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group
to actions such as realising security (if any is held);
or
— the ﬁnancial asset is more than 90 days past due,
but additional analysis is conducted for each such
receivable and assessment is updated accordingly.
The maximum period considered when estimating
ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the
225

Financial Statements

Group is exposed to credit risk.
ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of
all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash
ﬂows due to the entity in accordance with the contract
and the cash ﬂows that the Group expects to receive).
ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the
ﬁnancial asset in case of long-term assets.
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether ﬁnancial assets carried at amortised cost are credit-impaired. A ﬁnancial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one
or more events that have a detrimental impact on the
estimated future cash ﬂows of the ﬁnancial asset have
occurred.
Loss allowances for ﬁnancial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount
of the assets. Impairment losses related to trade and
other receivables are presented as part of net other operating expenses.
For assets in the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment model,
impairment losses are generally expected to increase
and become more volatile. The Group has determined
that the application of IFRS 9’s impairment requirements at 1 January 2018 does not result in signiﬁcant
additional impairment allowance and thus has not recognized any additional allowance as part of transition to
the new standards.

226

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The following analysis provides further detail about the
calculation of ECLs related to trade receivables on the
adoption of IFRS 9. The Group uses an allowance matrix
to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from the customers. Loss rates are calculated using a ‘roll rate’ method based on the probability of a receivable progressing
through successive stages of delinquency to write-off.
The ECLs were calculated based on actual credit loss
experience over the past two years. The Group performed the calculation of ECL rates separately for the
customers of each key trading company of the Group.
Exposures within each trading company were not further segmented except for individually signiﬁcant customers which bear speciﬁc credit risk depending on the
repayment history of the customer and relationship
with the Group. Actual credit loss experience was not
further adjusted as at 1 January 2018 as the Group has
not expected signiﬁcant adverse changes in economic
conditions during the period over which the historical
data was collected, current conditions and the Group’s
view of economic conditions over the expected lives of
the receivables. Potential impact of the sanctions described in Note 1(d) on further expected credit losses
assessment was not considered as could not be reliably estimated during the reporting period and is not
expected to have a signiﬁcant impact after 31 December
2018 due to sanctions lifting in January 2019 (note 1(d)).
The following table provides information about determined ECLs rates for trade receivables both as at 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018.

There were no changes during the period to the Group’s
exposure to credit risk that may impact the above loss
rates calculation. Fluctuations reﬂect differences between economic conditions during the period over
which the historical data has been collected, current
conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.
Hedge accounting
When initially applying IFRS 9, the Group may choose
as its accounting policy to continue to apply the hedge
accounting requirements of IAS 39 instead of the requirements in IFRS 9. The Group has chosen to apply
the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.
Transition
Changes in accounting policies resulting from the
adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively,
except as described below.
The Group has taken an exemption not to restate comparative information for prior periods with respect to
classiﬁcation and measurement (including impairment)
requirements. Accordingly, the information presented
for 2017 does not generally reﬂect the requirements of
IFRS 9 but rather those of IAS 39.
The determination of the business model within which
a ﬁnancial asset is held has been made on the basis of
the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of

initial application.
(b) Basis of measurement
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost basis except as set out in the signiﬁcant accounting policies in
the related notes below.
(c) Functional and presentation currency
The Company’s functional currency is the United States
Dollar (“USD”) because it reﬂects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances of
the Company. The functional currencies of the Group’s
signiﬁcant subsidiaries are the currencies of the primary
economic environment and key business processes of
these subsidiaries and include USD, Russian Roubles
(“RUB”), Ukrainian Hryvna and Euros (“EUR”). The consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in USD,
rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise
stated herein.
(d) Use of judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements in
conformity with IFRSs requires management to make
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
the application of accounting policies and reported
227

Financial Statements

amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, and the reported revenue and costs
during the relevant period.
Management bases its judgements and estimates on
historical experience and various other factors that are
believed to be appropriate and reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of
making the judgements about carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions and conditions.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the
period of the revision and future periods if the revision
affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of
IFRSs that have a signiﬁcant effect on the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements and estimates with a signiﬁcant risk
of material adjustment in the next year relate to:
— measurement of recoverable amount of property,
plant and equipment (note 13) and goodwill (note
14);
— measurement of net realizable value of inventories
(note 16);
— measurement of recoverable amount of investments in associates and joint ventures (note 15);
— estimates in respect of legal proceedings, restoration and exploration, taxation and pension reserve
(note 20).
(e) Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. The
Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the
entity and has the ability to affect those returns through
its power over the entity. When assessing whether the
Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the
Group and other parties) are considered.
An investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the
consolidated ﬁnancial statements from the date that
control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances, transactions and cash ﬂows and

228

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

any unrealised proﬁts arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements. Unrealised losses resulting from
intra-group transactions are eliminated in the same way
as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is
no evidence of impairment.
When the group loses control of a subsidiary, it is accounted for as a disposal of the entire interest in that
subsidiary, with a resulting gain or loss being recognised
in proﬁt or loss. Any interest retained in that former
subsidiary at the date when control is lost is recognised
at fair value and this amount is regarded as the fair value
on initial recognition of a ﬁnancial asset or, when appropriate, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in
an associate or joint venture.
(ii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group
transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Unrealised gains arising
from transactions with equity accounted investees are
eliminated against the investment to the extent of the
Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are
eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only
to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
(f) Foreign currencies
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into
the respective functional currencies of Group entities
at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated
to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that
date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary
items is the difference between the amortised cost in
the functional currency at the beginning of the period,
adjusted for effective interest and payments during
the period, and the amortised cost in foreign currency
translated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency
are measured based on historical cost and translated
using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are
recognised in the statement of income, except for differences arising on the retranslation of qualifying cash
ﬂow hedges to the extent the hedge is effective, which
is recognised in the other comprehensive income.

Financial Statements

(ii) Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated from their functional currencies
to USD at the exchange rates ruling at the reporting
date. The income and expenses of foreign operations
are translated to USD at exchange rates approximating
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences arising on translation are
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income
and presented in the currency translation reserve in
equity. For the purposes of foreign currency translation, the net investment in a foreign operation includes
foreign currency intra-group balances for which settlement is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable
future and foreign currency differences arising from
such a monetary item are recognised in the statement
of comprehensive income.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, such that control, signiﬁcant inﬂuence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of the currency translation reserve is
transferred to the statement of income as part of the
gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of
only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a
foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant
proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to
non-controlling interests. When the Group disposes of
only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining
signiﬁcant inﬂuence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassiﬁed to the
statement of income.

4 Segment reporting
(a) Reportable segments
An operating segment is a component of the Group
that engages in business activities from which it may
earn revenue and incur expenses, including revenue
and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the
Group’s other components. All operating segments’
operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s
CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for
which discrete consolidated ﬁnancial information or
statements are available.
Individually material operating segments are not aggregated for ﬁnancial reporting purposes unless the segments have similar economic characteristics and are
similar in respect of the nature of products and services,

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

the nature of production processes, the type or class of
customers, the methods used to distribute the products
or provide the services and the nature of the regulatory
environment. Operating segments which are not individually material may be aggregated if they share a majority of these criteria.
The Group has four reportable segments, as described
below, which are the Group’s strategic business units.
These business units are managed separately and the
results of their operations are reviewed by the CEO on
a regular basis.

Aluminium. The Aluminium segment is involved in the
production and sale of primary aluminium and related
products.
Alumina. The Alumina segment is involved in the mining and reﬁning of bauxite into alumina and the sale of
alumina.
Energy. The Energy segment includes the Group companies and projects engaged in the mining and sale of
coal and the generation and transmission of electricity
produced from various sources. Where the generating
facility is solely a part of an alumina or aluminium production facility it is included in the respective reportable segment.
Mining and Metals. The Mining and Metals segment
includes the equity investment in PJSC MMC Norilsk
Nickel (“Norilsk Nickel”).
Other operations include manufacturing of semiﬁnished products from primary aluminium for the
transportation, packaging, building and construction,
consumer goods and technology industries; and the activities of the Group’s administrative centres. None of
these segments meet any of the quantitative thresholds
for determining reportable segments in 2018 and 2017.
The Aluminium and Alumina segments are vertically
integrated whereby the Alumina segment supplies alumina to the Aluminium segment for further reﬁning
and smelting with limited sales of alumina outside the
Group. Integration between the Aluminium, Alumina
and Energy segments also includes shared servicing and
distribution.
(b) Segment results, assets and liabilities
For the purposes of assessing segment performance and
allocating resources between segments, the Group’s
senior executive management monitor the results, assets and liabilities attributable to each reportable segment on the following bases:

229

Financial Statements

Segment assets include all tangible, intangible assets
and current assets with the exception of income tax
assets and corporate assets. Segment liabilities include
trade and other payables attributable to the production
and sales activities of the individual segments. Loans
and borrowings are not allocated to individual segments as they are centrally managed by the head ofﬁce.
Revenue and expenses are allocated to the reportable
segments with reference to sales generated by those
segments and the expenses incurred by those segments
or which otherwise arise from the depreciation or amortisation of assets attributable to those segments excluding impairment.
The measure used for reporting segment results is the
statement of income before income tax adjusted for
items not speciﬁcally attributed to individual segments,
such as ﬁnance income, costs of loans and borrowings
and other head ofﬁce or corporate administration costs.
The segment proﬁt or loss is included in the internal

230

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

management reports that are reviewed by the Group’s
CEO. Segment proﬁt or loss is used to measure performance as management believes that such information
is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain
segments relative to other entities that operate within
these industries.
In addition to receiving segment information concerning segment results, management is provided with segment information concerning revenue (including intersegment revenue), the carrying value of investments and
share of proﬁts/(losses) of associates and joint ventures,
depreciation, amortisation, impairment and additions
of non-current segment assets used by the segments
in their operations. Inter-segment pricing is determined
on a consistent basis using market benchmarks.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred
during the year to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill.

(iii) Geographic information
The Group’s operating segments are managed on a
worldwide basis, but operate in four principal geographical areas: the CIS, Europe, Africa and the Americas. In
the CIS, production facilities operate in Russia and
Ukraine. In Europe, production facilities are located in
Italy, Ireland and Sweden. African production facilities
are represented by bauxite mines and an alumina reﬁnery in Guinea and an aluminium plant in Nigeria. In the
Americas the Group operates one production facility in
Jamaica, one in Guyana and a trading subsidiary in the
United States of America.

234

The following table sets out information about the
geographical location of (i) the Group’s revenue from
external customers and (ii) the Group’s property, plant
and equipment, intangible assets and interests in associates and joint ventures (“speciﬁed non-current assets”). The geographical location of customers is based
on the location at which the services were provided or
the goods were delivered. The geographical location of
the speciﬁed non-current assets is based on the physical location of the asset. Unallocated speciﬁed noncurrent assets comprise mainly goodwill and interests
in associates and joint ventures.

The Group’s customer base is diversiﬁed and includes
only one major customer - Glencore International AG (a
member of Glencore International Plc which is a shareholder of the Company with a 8.75% share – refer to
note 1(a)) - with whom transactions have exceeded 10%
of the Group’s revenue. In 2018 revenues from sales of
primary aluminium and alloys to this customer amounted to USD3,115 million (2017: USD2,431 million).

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Revenue from sale of primary aluminium and alloys
relates to aluminium segment (Note 4). Revenue from
sales of alumina and bauxite relates to alumina segment
which also includes sale of other products. Revenue
from sale of foil and other aluminium products and other products and services relates mostly to the revenue
of non-reportable segments.

(c) Personnel costs
Accounting policies
Personnel costs comprise salaries, annual bonuses, annual leave and cost of non-monetary beneﬁts. Salaries,
annual bonuses, paid annual leave and cost of non-monetary beneﬁts are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees. Where payment or settlement is deferred and the effect would be
material, these amounts are stated at their present values.
The employees of the Group are also members of retirement schemes operated by local authorities. The
Group is required to contribute a certain percentage of
their payroll to these schemes to fund the beneﬁts. The
Group’s total contribution to those schemes charged to
the statement of income during the years presented is
shown below.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of deﬁned beneﬁt
pension and other post-retirement plans is calculated
separately for each plan by estimating the amount of
future beneﬁt that employees have earned in return
for their service in the current and prior periods; that
beneﬁt is discounted to determine its present value
and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The
discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on gov-

ernment bonds that have maturity dates approximating
the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation
is performed using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a beneﬁt to the Group,
the recognised asset is limited to the net total of any
unrecognised past service costs and the present value
of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Where there is a change in actuarial assumptions, the
resulting actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
When the beneﬁts of a plan are improved, the portion
of the increased beneﬁt relating to past service by employees is recognised in the statement of income on a
straight-line basis over the average period until the beneﬁts become vested. To the extent that the beneﬁts vest
immediately, the expense is recognised immediately.
The Group recognises gains and losses on the curtailment or settlement of a deﬁned beneﬁt plan when the
curtailment or settlement occurs.
The gain or loss on curtailment comprises any resulting
change in the fair value of plan assets, any change in
the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation, any
related actuarial gains and losses.

7 Finance income and expenses
Accounting policies
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, changes in the fair value of ﬁnancial assets at fair
value through proﬁt or loss and foreign currency gains.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value of
ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss. All
borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of income using the effective interest method, except for
borrowing costs related to the acquisition, construction
and production of qualifying assets which are recognised as part of the cost of such assets.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net
basis.

8 Income tax
Accounting policies
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred
tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement
of income and other comprehensive income except to
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in
equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable
income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment
to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not
recognised for the following temporary differences: the
initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of

246

assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business
combination and that affects neither accounting nor
taxable proﬁt, and differences relating to investments
in subsidiaries to the extent that they probably will not
reverse in the foreseeable future. New information may
become available that causes the Company to change
its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax
liability. Such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax
expenses in the period that such a determination is
made. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are
expected to be applied to the temporary differences
when they reverse, based on the laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they
relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group has both the right and the intention to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a
net or simultaneous basis.

Financial Statements

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it
is probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available
against which temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date
and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax beneﬁt will be realised.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution
of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividends is recognised.

The Company is a tax resident of Cyprus with an applicable corporate tax rate of 12.5%. Subsidiaries pay
income taxes in accordance with the legislative requirements of their respective tax jurisdictions. For subsidiaries domiciled in Russia, the applicable tax rate is
20%; in Ukraine of 18%; Guinea of 0%; China of 25%;
Kazakhstan of 20%; Australia of 30%; Jamaica of 25%;
Ireland of 12.5%; Sweden of 22% and Italy of 27.9%. For
the Group’s subsidiaries domiciled in Switzerland the
applicable tax rate for the period is the corporate income tax rate in the Canton of Zug, Switzerland, which
may vary depending on the subsidiary’s tax status. The

rate consists of a federal income tax and cantonal/communal income and capital taxes. The latter includes a
base rate and a multiplier, which may change from year
to year. Applicable income tax rates for 2017 are 9.27%
and 14.60% for different subsidiaries. For the Group’s
signiﬁcant trading companies, the applicable tax rate
is 0%. The applicable tax rates for the year ended 31
December 2018 were the same as for the year ended
31 December 2017 except for tax rates for subsidiaries
domiciled in Switzerland which amounted to 9.6% and
14.51% accordingly.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect

can utilise the beneﬁts therefrom. Tax losses expire in
the following years:

(e) Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities
Retained earnings of the Group’s subsidiaries where
dividend distributions are subject to taxation included
USD1,778 million and USD1,387 million as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, respectively, for which
deferred taxation has not been provided because remittance of the earnings has been indeﬁnitely postponed
through reinvestment and, as a result, such amounts

252

are considered to be permanently invested. It was not
practicable to determine the amount of temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries where
the Group is able to control the timing of reversal of the
difference. Reversal is not expected in the foreseeable
future. For other subsidiaries in the Group, including the
signiﬁcant trading companies, the distribution of dividends does not give rise to taxes.

13 Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policies
(i) Recognition and measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment, are measured
at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment at 1
January 2004, the date of transition to IFRSs, was determined by reference to its fair value at that date.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable
to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct
labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing
the asset to a working condition for its intended use, the
costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalised
borrowing costs. Purchased software that is integral to
the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised
as part of that equipment.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment
have different useful lives, they are accounted for as
separate items (major components) of property, plant
and equipment.
The cost of periodic relining of electrolysers is capitalised and depreciated over the expected production
period.
Gains or losses on disposal of an item of property, plant
and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, and are recognised net within
gain/(loss) on disposal of property, plant and equipment
in the statement of income.
(ii) Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing a part of an item of property, plant
and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of
the item if it is probable that the future economic beneﬁts embodied within the part will ﬂow to the Group and
its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount
of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs of the
day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment
are recognised in the statement of income as incurred.
(iii) Exploration and evaluation assets
Exploration and evaluation activities involve the search
for mineral resources, the determination of technical
feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability

262

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

of an identiﬁed resource. Exploration and evaluation
activities include:
— researching and analysing historical exploration
data;
— gathering exploration data through topographical,
geochemical and geophysical studies;
— exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling;
— determining and examining the volume and grade
of the resource;
— surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements; and
— conducting market and ﬁnance studies.
Administration costs that are not directly attributable
to a speciﬁc exploration area are charged to the statement of income.
License costs paid in connection with a right to explore
in an existing exploration area are capitalised and amortised over the term of the permit.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised as
exploration and evaluation assets when it is expected
that expenditure related to an area of interest will be
recouped by future exploitation, sale, or, at the reporting date, the exploration and evaluation activities have
not reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially recoverable ore
reserves. Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is recorded as a component of property, plant
and equipment at cost less impairment losses. As the
asset is not available for use, it is not depreciated. All
capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is
monitored for indications of impairment. Where there
are indicators of potential impairment, an assessment
is performed for each area of interest in conjunction
with the group of operating assets (representing a cashgenerating unit) to which the exploration is attributed.
Exploration areas at which reserves have been discovered but which require major capital expenditure before production can begin are continually evaluated to
ensure that commercial quantities of reserves exist or
to ensure that additional exploration work is underway
or planned. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is
not expected to be recovered it is charged to the statement of income.
Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to
mining property, plant and equipment or intangible assets when development is sanctioned.

Financial Statements

(iv) Stripping costs
Expenditure relating to the stripping of overburden layers of ore, including estimated site restoration costs,
is included in the cost of production in the period in
which it is incurred.
(v) Mining assets
Mining assets are recorded as construction in progress
and transferred to mining property, plant and equipment when a new mine reaches commercial production.
Mining assets include expenditure incurred for:
— Acquiring mineral and development rights;
— Developing new mining operations.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Mining assets include interest capitalised during the
construction period, when ﬁnanced by borrowings.
(vi) Depreciation
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment
(including initial and any subsequent capital expenditure) are depreciated to their estimated residual value
over the estimated useful lives of the speciﬁc assets
concerned, or the estimated life of the associated mine
or mineral lease, if shorter. Estimates of residual values
and useful lives are reassessed annually and any change
in estimate is taken into account in the determination
of remaining depreciation charges. Leased assets are
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their
useful lives. Freehold land is not depreciated.

The property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line or units of production basis over the respective
estimated useful lives as follows:
—Buildings
—Plant, machinery and equipment
—Electrolysers
—Mining assets
—Other (except for exploration and evaluation assets)

30 to 50 years;
5 to 40 years;
4 to 15 years;
units of production on proven and probable reserves;
1 to 20 years.

Depreciation expense of USD496 million (2017: USD468
million) has been charged to cost of goods sold, USD3
million (2017: USD3 million) to distribution expenses
and USD12 million (2017: USD13 million) to administrative expenses.
During the year ended 31 December 2018 interest expense
of USD20 million was capitalised following commencement of active construction at several projects (2017:
USD16 million).
Included into construction in progress at 31 December
2018 and 2017 are advances to suppliers of property, plant
and equipment of USD32 million and USD134 million, respectively.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment subject to lien under loan agreements was USD3 million as
at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: USD3 million),
refer to note 19.
(a) Impairment
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies, each
asset or cash generating unit is evaluated every reporting
period to determine whether there are any indications of
impairment. If any such indication exists, a formal estimate
of recoverable amount is performed and an impairment
loss recognised to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of
an asset or cash generating group of assets is measured at
the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Fair value is determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties and is
generally determined as the present value of the estimated
future cash ﬂows expected to arise from the continued use
of the asset, including any expansion prospects, and its
eventual disposal.
Value in use is also generally determined as the present
value of the estimated future cash ﬂows, but only those
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its
present form and its eventual disposal. Present values are
determined using a risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the risks inherent in the asset. Future cash ﬂow
estimates are based on expected production and sales volumes, commodity prices (considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors), bauxite reserve
estimate, operating costs, restoration and rehabilitation
costs and future capital expenditure.
Bauxite reserves are estimates of the amount of product
that can be economically and legally extracted from the
Group’s properties. In order to calculate reserves, estimates
270

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

and assumptions are required about a range of geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities,
grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production
costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity
prices and exchange rates. The Group determines ore reserves under the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves September 1999, known
as the JORC Code. The JORC Code requires the use of
reasonable investment assumptions to calculate reserves.
Management identiﬁed several factors that indicated that
for a number of Group’s cash-generating units previously
recognised impairment loss may require reversal and for
a number of cash-generating units impairment loss shall
be recognised. These include signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations of
aluminium and alumina prices during the year as result of
LME and overall market instability. In aluminium production, the Group faced increase in cash cost due to increase
in alumina costs partially counterbalanced by application
of cash cost control measures. For alumina cash generating units, major inﬂuence was on the part of recovery in
alumina prices, increase in prices of energy resources being
a signiﬁcant part of cash cost and unbalanced change in
alumina and bauxite prices. Bauxite cash generating units
incurred more or less stable sale price of bauxite.
For the purposes of impairment testing the recoverable
amount of each cash generating unit was determined by
discounting expected future net cash ﬂows of the cash
generating unit.
Based on results of impairment testing as at 31 December
2018, management has concluded that a reversal of previously recognised impairment loss relating to property,
plant and equipment should be recognised in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements in respect BAZ and UAZ
cash generating unit in the amount of USD177 million.
Additionally, management has concluded that an impairment loss in respect of Cobad cash generating unit in the
amount of USD78 million should be recognised in these
consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Based on results of impairment testing as at 31 December
2017, management has concluded that a reversal of previously recognised impairment loss relating to property,
plant and equipment should be recognised in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements in respect of the Windalco
cash generating unit in the amount of USD63 million.
For the purposes of impairment testing the recoverable
amount of each cash generating unit was determined by
discounting expected future net cash ﬂows of the cash
generating unit. The pre-tax discount rates applied to the
above mentioned cash generating units, estimated in nominal terms based on an industry weighted average cost of
capital, are presented in the table below.

The recoverable amount of a number of the cash generating units tested for impairment are particularly sensitive to changes in forecast aluminium and alumina prices, foreign exchange rates and applicable discount rates.
Additionally, management identiﬁed speciﬁc items of
property, plant and equipment that are no longer in
use and therefore are not considered to be recoverable
amounting to USD146 million at 31 December 2018
(2017: USD83 million). These assets have been impaired in full. No further impairment of property, plant
and equipment or reversal of previously recorded impairment was identiﬁed by management.
(b) Leased assets
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are
classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases. Upon initial recognition the
leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum
lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the

272

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
The corresponding ﬁnance lease obligation is included
within interest-bearing liabilities. The interest element
is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term
to reﬂect a constant rate of interest on the remaining
balance of the obligation for each accounting period.
Assets held under other leases (operating leases) are
not recognised in the statement of ﬁnancial position.
Payments made under the lease are charged to the
statement of income in equal instalments over the
accounting periods covered by the lease term, except
where an alternative basis is more representative of the
pattern of beneﬁts to be derived from the leased assets.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the statement of income as an integral part of the aggregate net
lease payments made. Contingent rentals are charged
to the statement of income in the accounting period in
which they are incurred.

14 Intangible assets
Accounting policies
(i) Goodwill
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, an interest in a joint
venture or an associate or an interest in a joint arrangement that comprises a business, the identiﬁable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired business (or interest in a business) are recognised at their
fair values unless the fair values cannot be measured
reliably. Where the fair values of assumed contingent liabilities cannot be measured reliably, no liability is recognised but the contingent liability is disclosed in the
same manner as for other contingent liabilities.
Goodwill arises when the cost of acquisition exceeds
the fair value of the Group’s interest in the net fair value
of identiﬁable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. For this
purpose, goodwill arising on a business combination
is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to
beneﬁt from the acquisition and any impairment loss
recognised is not reversed even where circumstances
indicate a recovery in value.
When the fair value of the Group’s share of identiﬁable
net assets acquired exceeds the cost of acquisition, the
difference is recognised immediately in the statement
of income.
In respect of associates or joint ventures, the carrying
amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount
of the interest in the associate and joint venture and the
investment as a whole is tested for impairment whenever there is objective evidence of impairment. Any impairment loss is allocated to the carrying amount of the
interest in the associate and joint venture.
(ii) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the
prospect of gaining new scientiﬁc or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the statement
of income when incurred.
Development activities involve a plan or design for the
production of new or substantially improved products
and processes. Development expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reli-

274

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

ably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic beneﬁts are probable
and the Group intends to and has sufﬁcient resources
to complete development and to use or sell the asset.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overhead costs that are directly
attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use
and capitalised borrowing costs. Other development
expenditure is recognised in the statement of income
when incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at
cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated
impairment losses.
(iii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group,
which have ﬁnite useful lives, are measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
(iv) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic beneﬁts embodied in the
speciﬁc asset to which it relates. All other expenditure,
including expenditure on internally generated goodwill
and brands, is recognised in the statement of income
when incurred.
(v) Amortisation
Amortisation is recognised in the statement of income
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date
that they are available for use. The estimated useful
lives are as follows:
—software
—other

5 years;
2-8 years.

The amortisation method, useful lives and residual
values are reviewed at each ﬁnancial year end and adjusted if appropriate.

(a) Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible
assets

Goodwill recognised in these consolidated ﬁnancial
statements initially arose on the formation of the Group
in 2000 and the acquisition of a 25% additional interest
in the Group by its controlling shareholder in 2003. The
amount of goodwill was principally increased in 2007 as
a result of the acquisition of certain businesses of SUAL
Partners and Glencore.

For the purposes of impairment testing, the entire
amount of goodwill is allocated to the aluminium segment of the Group’s operations. The aluminium segment represents the lowest level within the Group at
which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount represents value in use as determined by discounting the future cash
ﬂows generated from the continuing use of the plants
within the Group’s aluminium segment.
Similar considerations to those described above in respect of assessing the recoverable amount of property,
plant and equipment apply to goodwill.

276

Financial Statements

At 31 December 2018, management analysed changes
in the economic environment and developments in the
aluminium industry and the Group’s operations since 31
December 2017 and performed an impairment test for
goodwill at 31 December 2018 using the following assumptions to determine the recoverable amount of the
segment:
— Total production was estimated based on average
sustainable production levels of 3.8 million metric
tonnes of primary aluminium, of 8.1 million metric
tonnes of alumina and of 16.5 million metric tonnes
of bauxite. Bauxite and alumina will be used primarily internally for production of primary aluminium;
— Sales prices were based on the long-term aluminium price outlook derived from available
industry and market sources at USD2,117 per tonne
for primary aluminium in 2019, USD2,159 in 2020,
USD2,193 in 2021, USD2,193 in 2022, USD2,216 in
2023. Operating costs were projected based on the
historical performance adjusted for inﬂation;
— Nominal foreign currency exchange rates applied to
convert operating costs of the Group denominated
in RUB into USD were RUB66.8 for one USD in
2019, RUB68.3 in 2020, RUB66.7 in 2021, RUB65.1
in 2022, RUB65.0 in 2023. Inﬂation of 4.0% – 4.5%
in RUB and 1.6% - 2.4% in USD was assumed in
determining recoverable amounts;
— The pre-tax discount rate was estimated in nominal
terms based on the weighted average cost of capital
basis and was 15.9%;
— A terminal value was derived following the forecast
period assuming a 1.7% annual growth rate.
Values assigned to key assumptions and estimates used
to measure the units’ recoverable amount was based
on external sources of information and historic data.
Management believes that the values assigned to the
key assumptions and estimates represented the most
realistic assessment of future trends. The results were
particularly sensitive to the following key assumptions:
— A 5% reduction in the projected aluminium price
level would have resulted in a decrease in the recoverable amount by 22% but would not lead to an
impairment;
— A 5% increase in the projected level of electricity and alumina costs in the aluminium production would have resulted in a 14% decrease in
the recoverable amount but would not lead to an
impairment;
— A 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a 8% decrease in the recoverable amount
but would not lead to an impairment.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Based on results of impairment testing of goodwill,
management concluded that no impairment should be
recorded in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as at
31 December 2018.
At 31 December 2017, management analysed changes
in the economic environment and developments in the
aluminium industry and the Group’s operations since 31
December 2016 and performed an impairment test for
goodwill at 31 December 2017 using the following assumptions to determine the recoverable amount of the
segment:
— Total production was estimated based on average
sustainable production levels of 3.8 million metric
tonnes of primary aluminium, of 8.0 million metric
tonnes of alumina and of 12.3 million metric tonnes
of bauxite. Bauxite and alumina will be used primarily internally for production of primary aluminium;
— Sales prices were based on the long-term aluminium price outlook derived from available industry
and market sources at USD2,058 per tonne for
primary aluminium in 2018, USD2,043 in 2019,
USD2,035 in 2020, USD2,037 in 2021, USD2,053 in
2022. Operating costs were projected based on the
historical performance adjusted for inﬂation;
— Nominal foreign currency exchange rates applied to
convert operating costs of the Group denominated
in RUB into USD were RUB62.3 for one USD in
2018, RUB61.4 in 2019, RUB62.2 in 2020, RUB60.5
in 2021, RUB59.5 in 2022. Inﬂation of 3.9% – 4.9%
in RUB and 1.3% - 2.3% in USD was assumed in
determining recoverable amounts;
— The pre-tax discount rate was estimated in nominal
terms based on the weighted average cost of capital
basis and was 13.1%;
— A terminal value was derived following the forecast
period assuming a 1.7% annual growth rate.
Values assigned to key assumptions and estimates used
to measure the units’ recoverable amount was based
on external sources of information and historic data.
Management believes that the values assigned to the
key assumptions and estimates represented the most
realistic assessment of future trends. The results were
particularly sensitive to the following key assumptions:
— A 5% reduction in the projected aluminium price
level would have resulted in a decrease in the recoverable amount by 26% but would not lead to an
impairment;
— A 5% increase in the projected level of electricity and alumina costs in the aluminium production
would have resulted in a 17% decrease in the re277

coverable amount but would not lead to an impairment;
— A 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a 7% decrease in the recoverable amount
but would not lead to an impairment.

When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest
in the associate or the joint venture, the Group’s interest is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is
discontinued except to the extent that the Group has
incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.

Based on results of impairment testing of goodwill,
management concluded that no impairment should be
recorded in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as at
31 December 2017.

Unrealised proﬁts and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates and joint
venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee, except where unrealised losses
provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case they are recognised immediately
in proﬁt or loss.

15 Interests in associates and joint ventures
Accounting policies
An associate is an entity in which the Group or Company has signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control or joint
control, over its management, including participation in
the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions.
A joint venture is an arrangement whereby the Group or
Company and other parties contractually agree to share
control of the arrangement, and have rights to the net
assets of the arrangement.
An investment in an associate or a joint venture is accounted for in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
under the equity method, unless it is classiﬁed as held
for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classiﬁed
as held for sale). Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost, adjusted for any excess
of the Group’s share of the acquisition-date fair values
of the investee’s identiﬁable net assets over the cost
of the investment (if any). Thereafter, the investment is
adjusted for the post acquisition change in the Group’s
share of the investee’s net assets and any impairment
loss relating to the investment. Any acquisition-date
excess over cost, the Group’s share of the post-acquisition, post-tax results of the investees and any impairment losses for the year are recognised in the consolidated statement of income, whereas the Group’s share
of the post-acquisition post-tax items of the investees’
other comprehensive income is recognised in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.

278

In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies,
each investment in an associate or joint venture is
evaluated every reporting period to determine whether
there are any indications of impairment after application of the equity method of accounting. If any such indication exists, a formal estimate of recoverable amount
is performed and an impairment loss recognised to the
extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an investment
in an associate or joint venture is measured at the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Similar considerations to those described above in respect of assessing the recoverable amount of property,
plant and equipment apply to investments in associates
or joint venture. In addition to the considerations described above the Group may also assess the estimated
future cash ﬂows expected to arise from dividends to
be received from the investment, if such information is
available and considered reliable.

(a) PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel

(b) Queensland Alumina Limited (“QAL”)

The Group’s investment in Norilsk Nickel is accounted
for using equity method and the carrying value as at
31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 amounted
USD3,101 million and USD3,796 million, respectively.
The market value amounted USD8,286 million and
USD8,294 million as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, respectively, and is determined by multiplying the quoted bid price per share on the Moscow
Exchange on the year-end date by the number of shares
held by the Group.

The carrying value of the Group’s investment in
Queensland Alumina Limited as at both 31 December
2018 and 31 December 2017 amounted to USD nil million. At 31 December 2018 management has not identiﬁed any impairment reversal indicators relating to the
Group’s investment in QAL and as a result no detailed
impairment testing was performed in relation to this investment.

(c) BEMO project
The carrying value of the Group’s investment in BEMO
project as at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017
amounted USD469 million and USD523 million, respectively.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the BEMO
project was separated into two cash generating units
– the Boguchansky Aluminium Smelter (“BoAZ’) and
the BEMO HPP (“BoGES”). The recoverable amount
was determined by discounting the expected future net
cash ﬂows of each cash generating unit.

At 31 December 2018 management has not identiﬁed
any impairment indicators relating to the Group’s investment in BoGES as well as any impairment reversal
indicators relating to investments in BoAZ and as a result no detailed impairment testing was performed in
relation to this investment.
At 31 December 2018, accumulated losses of USD639
million (2017: USD573 million) related to impairment
charges at BoAZ have not been recognised because the
Group’s investment has already been fully written down
to USD nil million.

16 Inventories
Accounting policies
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net
realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the
estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is determined under the weighted average cost method, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them
to their existing location and condition. In the case of
manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost
includes an appropriate share of production overheads
based on normal operating capacity.

284

The production costs include mining and concentrating
costs, smelting, treatment and reﬁning costs, other cash
costs and depreciation and amortisation of operating
assets.
The Group recognises write-downs of inventories
based on an assessment of the net realisable value of
the inventories. A write-down is applied to the inventories where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net realisable value is less than cost. The
determination of net realisable value requires the use
of judgement and estimates. Where the expectation is
different from the original estimates, such difference
will impact the carrying value of the inventories and the
write-down of inventories charged to the statement of
income in the periods in which such estimate has been
changed.

17 Non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments
Accounting policies
Non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments comprise investments in securities, trade and other receivables (excluding prepayments and tax assets), cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings and trade and other payables
(excluding advances received and tax liabilities).
Non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments except for trade
and other receivables are recognised initially at fair
value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Trade and other receivables are recognised at transaction price.

286

A ﬁnancial instrument is recognised when the Group
becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the
instrument. Financial assets are derecognised if the
Group’s contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from the
ﬁnancial assets expire or if the Group transfers the ﬁnancial asset to another party without retaining control
or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the Group’s obligations speciﬁed in the contract expire or are discharged
or cancelled.
The effect of initially applying IFRS 9 on the Group’s
ﬁnancial assets and liabilities and key accounting policies applied are described in Note 3. Due to the transition method chosen in applying IFRS 9, comparative
information has not been restated to reﬂect the new
requirements.

Ageing analysis is performed based on number of days
receivable is overdue. Trade receivables are on average
due within 60 days from the date of billing. The receivables that are neither past due nor impaired (i.e. current)
relate to a wide range of customers for whom there was
no recent history of default.
Receivables that were past due but not impaired relate
to a number of customers that have a good track record
with the Group. Based on past experience, management
believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in
respect of these balances as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the balances are still
considered fully recoverable. The Group does not hold
any collateral over these balances. Further details of the
Group’s credit policy are set out in note 22(e).

(ii) Loss allowance over trade receivables
The effect of initially applying IFRS 9 on the Group’s

comparative information has not been restated to reﬂect the new requirements.

20 Provisions
Accounting policies
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event,
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an
outﬂow of economic beneﬁts will be required to settle

the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ﬂows at a pre-tax rate that
reﬂects current market assessments of the time value
of money and the risks speciﬁc to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as ﬁnance costs.

(a) Pension liabilities
Group subsidiaries in the Russian Federation
The Group voluntarily provides long-term and postemployment beneﬁts to its former and existing employees including death-in-service, jubilee, lump sum upon
retirement, material support for pensioners and deathin-pension beneﬁts. Furthermore, the Group provides
regular social support payments to some of its veterans
of World War II.
The above employee beneﬁt programs are of a deﬁned
beneﬁt nature. The Group ﬁnances these programs on
a pay-as-you-go basis, so plan assets are equal to zero.
Group subsidiaries in Ukraine
Due to legal requirements, the Ukrainian subsidiaries
are responsible for partial ﬁnancing of the state hardship pensions for those of its employees who worked, or
still work, under severe and hazardous labour conditions
(hardship early retirement pensions). These pensions are
paid until the recipient reaches the age of entitlement
to the State old age pension (55-60 years for female
(dependent on year of birth) and 60 years for male employees). In Ukraine, the Group also voluntarily provides
long-term and post-employment beneﬁts to its employees including death-in-service, lump sum beneﬁts upon
retirement and death-in-pension beneﬁts.
The above employee beneﬁt programs are of a deﬁned
beneﬁt nature. The Group ﬁnances these programs on
a pay-as-you-go basis, so plan assets are equal to zero.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Group subsidiaries outside the Russian Federation and
Ukraine
At its Guinean and Nigerian entities the Group provides
a death-in-service beneﬁt and lump-sum beneﬁts upon
disability and old-age retirement.
At its Guyana subsidiary, the Group provides a death-inservice beneﬁt.
At its Italian subsidiary (Eurallumina) the Group only
provides lump sum beneﬁts upon retirement, which relate to service up to 1 January 2007.
In Sweden (Kubikenborg Aluminium AB), the Group
provides deﬁned beneﬁt lifelong and temporary pension beneﬁts. The lifelong beneﬁts are dependent on
the past service and average salary level of the employee, with an accrual rate that depends on the salary
bracket the employee is in. The liability relates only to
beneﬁts accrued before 1 January 2004.
The number of employees in all jurisdictions eligible for
the plans as at 31 December 2018 and 2017 was 58,089
and 57,423, respectively. The number of pensioners in
all jurisdictions as at 31 December 2018 and 2017 was
44,966 and 45,044, respectively.
The Group expects to pay under the deﬁned beneﬁt retirement plans an amount of USD4 million during the 12
month period beginning on 1 January 2019.

Financial Statements

As at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 the
Group’s obligations were fully uncovered as the Group
has only wholly unfunded plans.
(b) Site restoration
The mining, reﬁning and smelting activities of the
Group can give rise to obligations for site restoration and rehabilitation. Restoration and rehabilitation
works can include facility decommissioning and dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials, land
rehabilitation, and site restoration. The extent of work
required and the associated costs are dependent on
the requirements of law and the interpretations of the
relevant authorities.
The Group provides for site restoration obligations
when there is a speciﬁc legal or constructive obligation
for mine reclamation, landﬁll closure (primarily comprising red mud basin disposal sites) or speciﬁc lease
restoration requirements. The Group does not record
any obligations with respect to decommissioning of
its reﬁning or smelting facilities and restoration and
rehabilitation of the surrounding areas unless there is
a speciﬁc plan to discontinue operations at a facility.
This is because any signiﬁcant costs in connection with
decommissioning of reﬁning or smelting facilities and
restoration and rehabilitation of the surrounding areas
would be incurred no earlier than when the facility is
closed and the facilities are currently expected to operate over a term in excess of 50-100 years due to the
perpetual nature of the reﬁneries and smelters and continuous maintenance and upgrade programs resulting in
the fair values of any such liabilities being negligible.
Costs included in the provision encompass obligated
and reasonably estimable restoration and rehabilitation
activities expected to occur progressively over the life
of the operation and at the time of closure in connection with disturbances at the reporting date. Routine
operating costs that may impact the ultimate restoration and rehabilitation activities, such as waste material
handling conducted as an integral part of a mining or
production process, are not included in the provision.
Costs arising from unforeseen circumstances, such as
the contamination caused by unplanned discharges, are
recognised as an expense and liability when the event
gives rise to an obligation which is probable and capable of reliable estimation.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Restoration and rehabilitation provisions are measured
at the expected value of future cash ﬂows, discounted
to their present value and determined according to the
probability of alternative estimates of cash ﬂows occurring for each operation. Discount rates used are speciﬁc
to the country in which the operation is located. Signiﬁcant judgements and estimates are involved in forming
expectations of future activities and the amount and
timing of the associated cash ﬂows. Those expectations
are formed based on existing environmental and regulatory requirements.
When provisions for restoration and rehabilitation are
initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset, representing part of the cost of acquiring the future economic beneﬁts of the operation. The
capitalised cost of restoration and rehabilitation activities is amortised over the estimated economic life of the
operation on a units of production or straight-line basis.
The value of the provision is progressively increased
over time as the effect of discounting unwinds, creating
an expense recognised as part of ﬁnance expenses.
Restoration and rehabilitation provisions are also adjusted for changes in estimates. Those adjustments are
accounted for as a change in the corresponding capitalised cost, except where a reduction in the provision is
greater than the unamortised capitalised cost, in which
case the capitalised cost is reduced to nil and the remaining adjustment is recognised in the statement of
income. Changes to the capitalised cost result in an adjustment to future amortisation charges. Adjustments to
the estimated amount and timing of future restoration
and rehabilitation cash ﬂows are a normal occurrence
in light of the signiﬁcant judgements and estimates
involved. Factors inﬂuencing those changes include
revisions to estimated reserves, resources and lives of
operations; developments in technology; regulatory requirements and environmental management strategies;
changes in the estimated costs of anticipated activities,
including the effects of inﬂation and movements in foreign exchange rates; and movements in general interest
rates affecting the discount rate applied.
The site restoration provision recorded in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements relates primarily to mine
reclamation and red mud basin disposal sites at alumina
reﬁneries and is estimated by discounting the risk-adjusted expected expenditure to its present value based
on the following key assumptions:

At each reporting date the Directors have assessed the
provisions for site restoration and environmental matters and concluded that the provisions and disclosures
are adequate.
(c) Provisions for legal claims
In the normal course of business the Group may be
involved in legal proceedings. Where management
considers that it is more likely than not that proceedings will result in the Group compensating third parties
a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the
amount expected to be paid. Where management considers that it is more likely than not that proceedings
will not result in the Group compensating third parties
or where, in rare circumstances, it is not considered possible to provide a sufﬁciently reliable estimate of the
amount expected to be paid, no provision is made for
any potential liability under the litigation but the circumstances and uncertainties involved are disclosed
as contingent liabilities. The assessment of the likely
outcome of legal proceedings and the amount of any
potential liability involves signiﬁcant judgement. As law
and regulations in many of the countries in which the
Group operates are continuing to evolve, particularly
in the areas of taxation, sub-soil rights and protection
of the environment, uncertainties regarding litigation
and regulation are greater than those typically found
in countries with more developed legal and regulatory
frameworks.

The Group’s subsidiaries are subject to a variety of lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of its business. As at
31 December 2018, there were several claims ﬁled against
the Group’s subsidiaries contesting breaches of contract
terms and non-payment of existing obligations. Management has reviewed the circumstances and estimated that
the amount of probable outﬂow related to these claims
should not exceed USD3 million (31 December 2017:
USD3 million). The amount of claims, where management assesses outﬂow as possible approximates USD31
million (31 December 2017: USD36 million).
At each reporting date the Directors have assessed the
provisions for litigation and claims and concluded that
the provisions and disclosures are adequate.
(d) Tax provisions
The Group’s accounting policy for taxation requires
management’s judgement in assessing whether deferred
tax assets and certain deferred tax liabilities are recognised in the statement of ﬁnancial position. Deferred
tax assets, including those arising from carried forward
tax losses, capital losses and temporary differences, are
recognised only where it is considered more likely than
not that they will be recovered, which is dependent on
the generation of sufﬁcient future taxable proﬁts. Deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences
in investments, caused principally by retained earnings

(a) the risk free rate for the year 2017-2018 represents an effective rate, which comprises rates differentiated by years of obligation settlement and by currencies in which the provisions
were calculated

312

Financial Statements

held in foreign tax jurisdictions, are recognised unless
repatriation of retained earnings can be controlled and
is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.
Assumptions about the generation of future taxable
proﬁts and repatriation of retained earnings depend on
management’s estimates of future cash ﬂows. These
depend on estimates of future production and sales
volumes, commodity prices, reserves, operating costs,
restoration and rehabilitation costs, capital expenditure,
dividends and other capital management transactions.
Assumptions are also required about the application
of income tax legislation. These estimates and assumptions are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence there is
a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of deferred
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities recognised on the
statement of ﬁnancial position and the amount of other

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

tax losses and temporary differences not yet recognised. In such circumstances, some or all of the carrying
amount of recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
may require adjustment, resulting in a corresponding
credit or charge to the statement of income.
The Group generally provides for current tax based
on positions taken (or expected to be taken) in its tax
returns. Where it is more likely than not that upon examination by the tax authorities of the positions taken
by the Group additional tax will be payable, the Group
provides for its best estimate of the amount expected
to be paid (including any interest and/or penalties) as
part of the tax charge.
At each reporting date the Directors have assessed the
provisions for taxation and concluded that the provisions and disclosures are adequate.

21 Derivative ﬁnancial assets/liabilities
Accounting policies
The Group enters, from time to time, into various derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage its exposure to
commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest
rate risk.
Embedded derivatives are separated from the host
contract and accounted for separately if the economic
characteristics and risks of the host contract and the
embedded derivative are not closely related, a separate
instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the deﬁnition of a derivative and
the combined instrument is not measured at fair value
through proﬁt or loss.
On initial designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item,
including the risk management objectives and strategy
in undertaking the hedge transaction and the hedged
risk, together with the methods that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The
Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of
the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments are expected
to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the
fair value or cash ﬂows of the respective hedged items
attributable to the hedged risk, and whether the actual results of each hedge are within a range of 80% 125%. For a cash ﬂow hedge of a forecast transaction,
the transaction should be highly probable to occur and
should present an exposure to variation in cash ﬂows
that ultimately could affect reported proﬁt or loss.
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in the statement of income when incurred. Subsequent to initial
recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value.

314

The measurement of fair value of derivative ﬁnancial
instruments, including embedded derivatives, is based
on quoted market prices. Where no price information
is available from a quoted market source, alternative
market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions,
fair value is estimated based on the Group’s views on
relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit
in such estimates. Changes in the fair value therein are
accounted for as described below.
When a derivative is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash ﬂows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction
that could affect proﬁt or loss, the effective portion of
changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised
in the statement of comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective
portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative is recognised in the statement of income.
When the hedged item is a non-ﬁnancial asset, the
amount accumulated in equity is included in the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is recognised.
In other cases, the amount accumulated in equity is reclassiﬁed to the statement of income in the same period
that the hedged item affects proﬁt or loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised,
or the designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is
discontinued prospectively. If the forecast transaction
is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in equity is reclassiﬁed to the statement of income.
Changes in the fair value of separated embedded derivatives and derivative ﬁnancial instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recognised immediately
in the statement of income.

in accordance with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
based on management estimates and consensus economic forecasts of relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling

and other risks implicit in such estimates. The Group’s
policy is to recognise transfers between levels of fair
value hierarchy as at the date of the event or change in
circumstances that caused the transfer. The following

ﬁnancial instruments compared to prior year.
Management believes that the values assigned to the
key assumptions and estimates represented the most
realistic assessment of future trends. The results for the
derivative instruments are not particularly sensitive to
any factors other than the assumptions disclosed above.
Petroleum coke supply contracts and other raw materials
In May and September 2011, the Group entered into
long-term petroleum coke supply contracts where the
price of coke is determined with reference to the LME
aluminium price and the Brent oil price. The strike price
for aluminium is set at USD2,403.45 per tonne and
USD1,735.03 per tonne, respectively, while the strike
price for oil is set at USD61.10 per barrel and USD47.7
per barrel, respectively.

316

In May 2014, the Group entered into long-term petroleum coke supply contract where the price of coke is
determined with reference to the LME aluminium price
and average monthly aluminium quotations, namely
of Aluminum MW US Transaction premium, MB Aluminium Premium Rotterdam Low - High and Aluminum
CIF Japan premium. The strike price for aluminium is set
at USD1,809.65 per tonne while the strike aluminium
premium quotations for US, Europe and Japan are set
at USD403.96 per tonne, USD313.30 per tonne and
USD366.00 per tonne, respectively.
In November 2015, the Group entered into long-term
pitch supply contract where the price of pitch is determined with reference to the LME aluminium price. The
strike price for aluminium is set at USD1,508 per tonne.

22 Financial risk management and fair values
(a) Fair values
Management believes that the fair values of short-term
ﬁnancial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying
amounts.
The methods used to estimate the fair values of the ﬁnancial instruments are as follows:
Trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents,
current loans and borrowings and trade and other payables: the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity period of the instruments.
Long-term loans and borrowings, other non-current liabilities: the fair values of other non-current liabilities
are based on the present value of the anticipated cash
ﬂows and approximate carrying value, other than Eurobonds and RUSAL Bratsk bonds issued.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The following table presents the fair value of Group’s
ﬁnancial instruments measured at the end of the reporting period on a recurring basis, categorised into the
three-level fair value hierarchy as deﬁned by IFRS 13,
Fair value measurement. The level into which a fair value measurement is classiﬁed is determined with reference to the observability and signiﬁcance of the inputs
used in the valuation technique as follows:
— Level 1 valuations: Fair value measured using only
Level 1 inputs i.e. unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date
— Level 2 valuations: Fair value measured using Level
2 inputs i.e. observable inputs which fail to meet
Level 1, and not using signiﬁcant unobservable
inputs. Unobservable inputs are inputs for which
market data are not available
— Level 3 valuations: Fair value measured using signiﬁcant unobservable inputs.

Derivatives: the fair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments, including embedded derivatives, is based
on quoted market prices. Where no price information
is available from a quoted market source, alternative
market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions,
fair value is estimated based on the Group’s views on
relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit
in such estimates. Option-based derivatives are valued
using Black-Scholes models and Monte-Carlo simulations. The derivative ﬁnancial instruments are recorded
at their fair value at each reporting date.

(b) Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial instruments comprise
bank loans and trade payables. The main purpose of
these ﬁnancial instruments is to raise ﬁnance for the
Group’s operations. The Group has various ﬁnancial assets such as trade receivables and cash and short-term
deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are cash ﬂow interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk. Management reviews
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks
which are summarised below.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the
establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has established a risk
management group within its Department of Internal
Control, which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group’s risk management policies. The Department reports regularly to the Board of Directors on
its activities.
The Group’s risk management policies are established
to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to
set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor
risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies
and systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂect changes
in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The
Group, through its training and management standards
and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees
understand their roles and obligations.

322

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to
the risks faced by the Group. The Group’s Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by the Group’s
Internal Audit function which undertakes both regular
and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and
procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
(c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices,
such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group’s income or the value
of its holdings of ﬁnancial instruments. The objective of
market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while
optimising returns.
(i) Commodity price risk
During the years ended 31 December 2018 and 2017,
the Group has entered into certain long-term electricity contracts and other commodity derivatives contracts in order to manage its exposure of commodity
price risks. Details of the contracts are disclosed in
notes 21 and 25(c).
(ii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market
interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term
debt obligations with ﬂoating interest rates (refer to
note 19). The Group’s policy is to manage its interest
costs by monitoring changes in interest rates with respect to its borrowings.

(iii) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies
of group entities, primarily USD but also the Russian
Rouble, Ukrainian Hryvna and Euros. The currencies
in which these transactions primarily are denominated are RUB, USD and EUR.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Borrowings are primarily denominated in currencies
that match the cash ﬂows generated by the underlying
operations of the Group, primarily USD but also RUB
and EUR. This provides an economic hedge.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures
that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The following tables indicate the instantaneous change
in the Group’s proﬁt before taxation (and accumulated
losses) and other comprehensive income that could arise

if foreign exchange rates to which the Group has signiﬁcant exposure at the reporting date had changed at that
date, assuming all other risk variables remained constant.

Results of the analysis as presented in the above tables
represent an aggregation of the instantaneous effects
on the Group entities’ proﬁt before taxation and other comprehensive income measured in the respective
functional currencies, translated into USD at the exchange rates ruling at the reporting date for presentation purposes.

326

The sensitivity analysis assumes that the change in foreign exchange rates had been applied to re-measure
those ﬁnancial instruments held by the Group which
expose the Group to foreign currency risk at the reporting date. The analysis excludes differences that would
result from the translation of other ﬁnancial statements
of foreign operations into the Group’s presentation
currency. The analysis has been performed on the same
basis for all years presented.

(d) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able
to meet its ﬁnancial obligations as they fall due. The
group policy is to maintain sufﬁcient cash and cash
equivalents or have available funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities to meet
its operating and ﬁnancial commitments.

The following tables show the remaining contractual
maturities at the reporting date of the Group’s nonderivative ﬁnancial liabilities, which are based on contractual undiscounted cash ﬂows (including interest
payment computed using contractual rates, or if ﬂoating, based on rates current at the reporting date) and the
earliest the Group can be required to pay.

At 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 the
Group’s guarantee in respect of credit arrangement between BoAZ and VEB (note 24(e)) is presented as contingent liability and included at maximum exposure for
the Group in the liquidity risk disclosure above.
(e) Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy
third parties. It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to
credit veriﬁcation procedures. The majority of the
Group’s third party trade receivables represent balances with the world’s leading international corporations operating in the metals industry. In addition,
receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group’s exposure to bad
debts is not signiﬁcant. Goods are normally sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event

328

of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of
trade and other receivables. The details of impairment of trade and other receivables are disclosed in
note 17. The extent of the Group’s credit exposure is
represented by the aggregate balance of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial guarantees given.
At 31 December 2018 and 2017, the Group has certain
concentrations of credit risk as 0% and 1.9% of the total trade receivables were due from the Group’s largest
customer and 6.7% and 9.5% of the total trade receivables were due from the Group’s ﬁve largest customers,
respectively (refer to note 5 for the disclosure on revenue from largest customer).
With respect to credit risk arising from guarantees, the
Group’s policy is to provide ﬁnancial guarantees only to
wholly-owned subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

(f) Capital risk management

23 Commitments

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to
safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders
and beneﬁts for other stakeholders and to maintain an
optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

(a) Capital commitments

The Group manages its capital structure and makes
adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new
shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so
as to maintain investor, creditor and market conﬁdence
and to sustain future development of the business. The
Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which
the Group deﬁnes as net operating income divided by
total shareholders’ equity, excluding non-controlling
interests. The Board of Directors also monitors the level
of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between higher
returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a
sound capital position.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year.
The Company and its subsidiaries were subject to externally imposed capital requirements in the both years
presented in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
(g) Master netting or similar agreements
The Group may enter into sales and purchase agreements with the same counterparty in the normal course
of business. The related amount receivable and payable do not always meet the criteria for offsetting in
the statement of ﬁnancial position. This is because the
Group may not have any currently legally enforceable
right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to
offset may be enforceable only on the occurrence of
future events.
There are no ﬁnancial instruments that meet the offsetting criteria in the statement of ﬁnancial position for the
year ended 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017.

The Group has entered into contracts that result in contractual obligations primarily relating to various construction and capital repair works. The commitments at
31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017 approximated USD255 million and USD213 million, respectively.
These commitments are due over a number of years.
(b) Purchase commitments
Commitments with third parties for purchases of alumina, bauxite, other raw materials and other purchases
in 2019-2034 under supply agreements are estimated
from USD2,932 million to USD3,527 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: USD3,593 million to
USD4,381 million) depending on the actual purchase
volumes and applicable prices.
Commitments with a related party - joint venture for
purchases of primary aluminium and alloys in 20192030 under supply agreements are estimated from
USD6,375 million to USD10,019 million (31 December
2017: USD6,837 million to USD9,351 million) depending on the actual purchase volumes and applicable prices. Electricity purchase commitments are disclosed in
note 25.
(c) Sale commitments
Commitments with third parties for sales of alumina
and other raw materials in 2019-2034 are estimated
from USD509 million to USD2,344 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: from USD815 million
to USD1,041 million) and will be settled at market prices
at the date of delivery. Commitments with related parties for sales of alumina in 2019-2020 approximated
from USD227 million to USD363 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: from USD414 million to
USD516 million).
Commitments with related parties for sales of primary
aluminium and alloys in 2019-2021 are estimated from
USD889 million to USD1,223 million at 31 December
2018 (31 December 2017: from USD4,358 million to
USD4,770 million). Commitments with third parties for
sales of primary aluminium and alloys in 2019-2021 are
estimated to range from USD832 million to USD1,155
million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: from
USD1,266 million to USD1,654 million).

(e) Social commitments

24 Contingencies

The Group contributes to the maintenance and upkeep of the local infrastructure and the welfare of its
employees, including contributions toward the development and maintenance of housing, hospitals, transport services, recreation and other social needs of the
regions of the Russian Federation where the Group’s
production entities are located. The funding of such assistance is periodically determined by management and
is appropriately capitalised or expensed as incurred.

(a) Taxation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject
to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur
frequently. Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the
Group may be challenged by the relevant local, regional
and federal authorities. Notably recent developments
in the Russian environment suggest that the authorities
in this country are becoming more active in seeking to
enforce, through the Russian court system, interpretations of the tax legislation, in particular in relation to
the use of certain commercial trading structures, which
may be selective for particular tax payers and different
to the authorities’ previous interpretations or practices.
Different and selective interpretations of tax regulations by various government authorities and inconsistent enforcement create further uncertainties in the
taxation environment in the Russian Federation.
In addition to the amounts of income tax the Group has
provided, there are certain tax positions taken by the
Group where it is reasonably possible (though less than
50% likely) that additional tax may be payable upon
examination by the tax authorities or in connection
with ongoing disputes with tax authorities. The Group’s
best estimate of the aggregate maximum of additional
amounts that it is reasonably possible may become
payable if these tax positions were not sustained at 31

330

Financial Statements

December 2018 is USD nil million (31 December 2017:
USD30 million).
(b) Environmental contingencies
The Group and its predecessor entities have operated
in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Jamaica, Guyana, the
Republic of Guinea and the European Union for many
years and certain environmental problems have developed. Governmental authorities are continually considering environmental regulations and their enforcement
and the Group periodically evaluates its obligations related thereto. As obligations are determined, they are
recognised immediately. The outcome of environmental liabilities under proposed or any future legislation,
or as a result of stricter enforcement of existing legislation, cannot reasonably be estimated. Under current
levels of enforcement of existing legislation, management believes there are no possible liabilities, which
will have a material adverse effect on the ﬁnancial position or the operating results of the Group. However, the
Group anticipates undertaking signiﬁcant capital projects to improve its future environmental performance
and to bring it into full compliance with current legislation.
(c) Legal contingencies
The Group’s business activities expose it to a variety of
lawsuits and claims which are monitored, assessed and
contested on the ongoing basis. Where management
believes that a lawsuit or another claim would result in
the outﬂow of the economic beneﬁts for the Group, a
best estimate of such outﬂow is included in provisions
in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (refer to note
20). As at 31 December 2018 the amount of claims,
where management assesses outﬂow as possible approximates USD31 million (31 December 2017: USD36
million).

ney General of Nigeria to the case as co-defendants.
The last hearing took place on 8 November 2017. The
claim was struck out. BFIG may appeal.
Based on a preliminary assessment of the claim, the
Company does not expect the case to have any material
adverse effect on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or its
operation as a whole.
In January 2018 one of the Company’s subsidiaries,
ALSCON and the Bureau of Public Enterprises of Nigeria entered into an addendum to the original sale and
purchase contract regarding ALSCON on the key terms
and conditions as it was disclosed in the announcement
of the Company dated 19 January 2018.
(d) Insurance and provision for guarantees
Where the Group enters into ﬁnancial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies, controlled by the shareholder which is a beneﬁcial
owner of the Group at the reporting date, the Group
considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Group
treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability
until such time as it becomes probable that the Group
will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
In September 2013 the Group entered into an agreement with PJSC RusHydro to provide funds to BoAZ,
if the latter is unable to fulﬁl its obligations under its
credit facility with GK Vnesheconombank (“VEB”). This
agreement represents a surety for the increased credit
limit obtained for the ﬁnancing of BoAZ. The aggregate
exposure under the agreement is limited to RUB16.8
billion (31 December 2018 and 2017 USD242 million
and USD292 million, respectively) and is split between
the Group and PJSC RusHydro in equal proportion.

In January 2013, the Company received a writ of summons and statement of claim ﬁled in the High Court of
Justice of the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria (Abuja) by plaintiff BFIG Group Divino Corporation (“BFIG”)
against certain subsidiaries of the Company. It is a claim
for damages arising out of the defendants’ alleged tortious interference in the bid process for the sale of the
Nigerian government’s majority stake in the Aluminium
Smelter Company of Nigeria Plc (“ALSCON”) and alleged loss of BFIG’s earnings resulting from its failed
bid for the said stake in ALSCON. BFIG sought compensatory damages in the amount of USD2.8 billion
plus interest.
In January 2014 the court granted the Company’s motion to join the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Attor331

Report.
Forward-looking statements may and often do differ materially from actual results. Any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report reﬂect the Group management’s current view with respect to future events and are
subject to risks relating to future events and other risks,
uncertainties and assumptions relating to the Group’s
business, results of operations, ﬁnancial position, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the bauxite, alumina

Agreement with the Company

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

APPENDIX A –
PRINCIPAL TERMS OF THE
SHAREHOLDERS’
AGREEMENT
WITH THE COMPANY

The principal terms of the Shareholders’ Agreement
with the Company are described below. Unless otherwise stated, references to En+, SUAL Partners, Glencore
and Onexim are deemed to include reference to other
entities controlled by these Major Shareholders (other
than any member of the Group).

Right of ﬁrst refusal — bauxite, alumina,
aluminium
The Major Shareholders must offer the Company a right
of ﬁrst refusal in respect of any assets or development
opportunities related to the production of bauxite, alumina or aluminium (“Industrial Assets”) that they wish to
acquire where such Industrial Asset or a group of related Industrial Assets has a value in excess of an amount
determined by reference to the prevailing LME (high
grade premium aluminium three month offer side) price
of aluminium at the time of the proposed acquisition.
If that LME price is USD1,500 per tonne or less then
the trigger value is USD500 million, if it is USD4,500
or more than the trigger price is USD1 billion and if it is
between these two prices then the trigger price is prorated on a straight line basis.
Each Major Shareholder must disclose to the Company any opportunity which has come to their (or their
associates’) respective attentions to acquire Industrial Assets of whatever value.

Relationship between the Company and the
Major Shareholders
Each Major Shareholder must ensure that any contract
between it or any of its associates and any member of
the Group is entered into on an arms’ length commercial basis and on terms that are not unfairly prejudicial
to the interests of any Major Shareholder or the Group.
If there is a dispute between a Major Shareholder or any
of its associates and the Company, that Shareholder will
not, and will procure that any Directors appointed by

356

it will not, do anything to prevent or hinder the Company’s handling of the dispute.
The Major Shareholders agree to act in good faith
in relation to the Group and in a manner that is not
unfairly prejudicial to the interests of the Shareholders generally, and that the Group will be operated in
accordance with the corporate governance standards
set out in the CG Code.

Termination for particular Shareholders
The Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company shall
terminate in respect of the relevant Major Shareholder
in the following circumstances:
— Upon Onexim ceasing to hold a minimum shareholding of 5% of the total Shares in issue, other
than as a result of dilution on a further share issue,
it shall lose all of its rights and obligations under
the Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company.
— If Onexim holds less than 5% of the total Shares in
issue, but still has any rights under the Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company, it shall lose all
of its rights and obligations under the Shareholders’
Agreement with the Company upon any subsequent
disposal by it of Shares or entry into derivative contracts or arrangements in relation to Shares.
— Upon any Major Shareholder ceasing to hold at
least 3% of the total Shares in issue, for whatever
reason, it shall lose all of its rights and obligations
under the Shareholders’ Agreement with
the Company.
— Subject to certain exceptions, if there is a change of
control of Glencore or a third party acquires all or
substantially all of Glencore’s assets, it shall lose its
rights and obligations of ﬁrst refusal outlined above.
— If there is a change of control of Onexim or a third
party acquires all or substantially all of Onexim’s assets, it shall lose all rights and its obligations under
the Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company.

Agreement with the Company

Effect of Shareholding Changes
during the Year
As a result of the Shareholding Changes during the
Year, the Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company
has terminated in respect of Onexim from the date it
ceased to be a Shareholder on 16 January 2018 and Onexim ceased to have any rights or obligations under the
Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company.
The Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company remains
valid and enforceable against Glencore as Glencore con-

tinues to hold more than 3% of the total Shares in issue
following the Shareholding Changes during the Year. It
is expected however that the Shareholders’ Agreement
with the Company shall terminate in respect of Glencore upon completion of the share swap contemplated
by the securities exchange agreement entered into between En+ and Glencore on 28 January 2019, expected
to be on or about 31 January 2020.

Annual Report RUSAL 2018

Effect of Shareholding Changes
during the Year
As a result of the Shareholding Changes during the Year,
the Shareholders’ Agreement among Major Shareholders has terminated in respect of Onexim from the date
it ceased to be a Shareholder on 16 January 2018 and
Onexim ceased to have any rights or obligations under
the Shareholders’ Agreement among Major Shareholders only. In particular, following its cessation as a Shareholder from 16 January 2018:
— Onexim ceased to have the right to propose for
nomination and removal any Director to the Board,
the board of RUSAL Global and RUSAL America
Corp and the board of Norilsk Nickel, or to have the
right to veto the appointment of any independent
Director;
— Onexim ceased to have the right to nominate any
persons for appointment to the standing committee
of the Board;
— Onexim ceased to be bound by undertakings in
respect of exercise of voting rights as it ceased to
hold any voting rights in the Company;
— Onexim ceased to have any right to veto any related
party transactions or matters which would require
approval of special resolution were the Company or
its relevant subsidiary incorporated in England and
Wales;
— Onexim ceased to have any tag along rights in respect of any sale of Shares by other Major Shareholders; and
— other Major Shareholders are no longer obliged to
seek the prior written consent of Onexim in respect
of procuring the Company or any of its subsidiaries to bid for or acquire, or to procure that Norilsk
Nickel will not bid for or acquire, certain speciﬁed
geological licenses relating to nickel, copper, platinum and cobalt.
The Shareholders’ Agreement with the Company remains valid and enforceable against Glencore as Glencore continues to hold more than 3% of the total Shares
in issue following the Shareholding Changes during
the Year. It is expected however that the Shareholders’
Agreement with the Company shall terminate in respect of Glencore upon completion of the share swap
contemplated by the securities exchange agreement
entered into between En+ and Glencore on 28 January
2019, expected to be on or about 31 January 2020. However, as Glencore ceased to hold at least 8.6% of the
total Shares in issue on 31 January 2019, from that date:
